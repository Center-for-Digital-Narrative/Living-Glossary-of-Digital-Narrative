## Explication

The term implied reader refers to an ideal recipient of a work whose disposition can be inferred from the text. The idea of the implied reader (in the form “postulated reader”) was first expressed in 1961 by Wayne C. Booth (137), who defined it as an image of the reader that the author creates when writing a work of fiction. The term rose to prominence when it was expanded on by Wolfgang Iser (34), who posits that the implied reader embodies all the tendencies to best experience a literary work. He emphasises that the implied reader is a construct that can be formed based on the text alone and is thus separate from the real reader (Iser 34). The term can be used to describe the knowledge levels and competences required to understand and form interpretations of a work. This can be evident in a work like Vladimir Nabokov’s _Pale Fire_ that requires attentive reading and background knowledge on literature (Phelan & Rabinowitz, 141). The concept of implied reader is often used within the context of the communicative model of reading, which describes the chain of communication between the sender and receiver of a work of literature (consisting of the real author, implied author, narrator, narratee, implied reader, and the real reader) (Chatman 151; Phelan 2–3). Similar concepts that differentiate the reader as a textual construct from the actual, flesh-and-blood reader include, among others, Umberto Eco’s (206–207) _model reader_, Peter J. Rabinowitz’s (21) _authorial audience_, and Wolf Schmid’s (53–54) _abstract reader_.

Digital media has brought new elements to the interaction between the reader and the text, and research on reading experiences of \[ergodic literature\] and the role of the player in the context of video games has broadened the concept of the implied reader. In 1997, Espen Aarseth (_Cybertext_ 127) introduced the term “implied user” and later expanded on it in the form of “implied player” (“Fought”). In his definition, implied player is “a role made for the player by the game, a set of expectations that the player must fulfil for the game to ‘exercise its effect’”. Aarseth further argues that implied player is more material than the implied reader, since the game cannot progress without the player’s input (“Fought” 184). Building on Aarseth’s definition, Gerald Farca (195–197) specifies that the implied player is a framework that describes what kind of roles the game offers for the player to perform, such as trying to win the game, experiencing the narrative, or exploring the game world. The concept of implied reader has also been reformulated to fit the context of interface design and \[platform studies\] with the conceptualisation of “implied user”, characterising what kind of user the designer of an artefact had in mind when making it (Armaselu).

The concept of implied reader, along with its counterpart, \[implied author\], has been both influential and heavily debated since its inception. The term has been criticised as superfluous; for instance, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan (89–92) and Marie-Laure Ryan (36) have argued that the concept is not necessary for discussing the communicative chain between the author and the reader. Theorists using the concept have also been criticised for providing little indication on how it should be used methodologically (Kindt 58) and for basing their assumptions on unverifiable speculation (Bortolussi & Dixon 7; Alber). Some have even suggested that, instead of using the concept of the implied reader, the study of the reading process and interpretation should turn solely to empirical research of real readers (Alber 37–38; Bortolussi & Dixon 13). A similar tension exists in game studies as well, between researchers who want to approach the player as a construct that can be inferred from the game and researchers who want to focus on the actual, historical players (_I Fought The Law_ 183).

Despite its criticisms, the concept of implied reader continues to be popular in research on literature and digital media. It can be regarded as a useful tool for discussing texts as products of intentional acts of communication without appealing directly to the real author’s wishes on how their audience should react to their work. For instance, the concept can be used to point out the differences between a hypertext reader and a reader of a conventional book (Oikonomidou), or to show how computer-generated works can have two implied readers in the sense that their reading experience can be altered depending on whether the reader reads the source code of the work or not (Hongisto).
