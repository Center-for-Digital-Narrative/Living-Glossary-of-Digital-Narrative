Fanfiction writing is commonly considered an expression of transformative fandom as opposed to “affirmative” fandom (Hills). While affirmative fandom activities only seek to confirm and echo the world as laid out by the author, fans may also choose to transform the source material through making art, reproducing and adjusting costumes, creating fake social media channels for individual characters, or in a myriad of other ways (see Busse “Geek Hierarchies”, Zygutis, Correa-Chávez).

Historically, the beginning of fanfiction as a practice is thought to have evolved from the formation of media fandoms, which in turn were heavily influenced by and closely connected to US American science fiction fandoms in the 1960s (Coppa). Often centred on or fuelled by relationships between characters, both platonic and not (Coppa, Jenkins Textual Poachers), transformative engagement with a source may include, but is not limited to, reworkings of characters, settings, elements or the entirety of the original plot, or genre. Through its transformative approach to a source text, fanfiction by definition interacts with and reworks concepts of authorship, creative hierarchies, and authorial intent, thus reflecting and playing out conflicting aspects of authorship inherent in all sorts of creative endeavours (Busse 20).

As a result, the academic study of fanfiction has given rise to new avenues of thinking about creative writing, such as Derecho’s understanding of fanfiction as not only antihierarchical, but more specifically archontic. Leaning on “Derrida’s understanding of archives as ever expanding and never completely closed” (61), she proposes an approach to fanfiction which understands any new story as a contribution to an archive with a constant “tendency toward enlargement and accretion” (64). Unlike the concept of intertextuality, she defines archontic literature as a form free from notions of hierarchy and property rights and comparative merits, “works which generate variations that explicitly announce themselves as variations” (65).

Partially by necessity, fanfiction cannot exist within a conventional capitalist system for fear of legal consequences over the ownership of creative rights. From this unique positioning result, not only elements of the landscape such as disclaimers (Busse and Hellekson), a rejection of the monetisation of fanfiction-adjacent creative efforts (Jones, Buchsbaum), and a general tendency of fanzines (where fanfiction as a fan activity began) to be sold at a loss (Jones), but also a general understanding of fanfiction to be functioning on a gift economy (Hellekson). Positioned as a female-coded opposition to a capitalist system centred around monetary value, the gift economy frames the exchange of creative fan labour in all its forms as constitutive of the social networks and larger metatext of fan communities (Hellekson). Consequently, while fannish meaning-making doubtlessly stands in connection with the individual involved in its construction (Jenkins 34), the contexts in which it is shared, received, and reacted to are inherently social, communal, and collaborative. In other words, fanfiction, while without specific value outside of a fannish system, is created, shared, gifted and exchanged as part of a networked community creatively engaging with one or multiple source(s). Since such collaborations have, in general, become easier in the digital age, this key characteristic of fanfiction as a social medium has been additionally facilitated by its transformation into a predominantly digital narrative format.

In conjunction with the predominance of female fans in _transformative_ fan spaces (centreoftheselights, Rouse and Stanfill, Hellekson), fanfiction’s non-commercial, antihierarchical, transformative nature has been argued to make the medium uniquely suitable to the exploration of topics of inclusivity and diversity, as well as to the development of democratic modes of engagement (Jenkins “Rethinking”, Derecho, Stanfill). Media fandom, and with it, the writing, receiving and exchanging of fanfiction, is thus viewed not only a female, but specifically a feminist activity (Busse 34–36; Hellekson). Values considered to be inherent to fannish activities – such as the centering of marginalised voices and themes – thus play a notable role in how both scholarship and fans themselves view transformative fandom.

With the introduction of the internet, media fandom, alongside fan fiction spaces, has moved to and across different online platforms (Coppa). One dominant factor in such platform migrations has always been a search for safety from censorship and discriminatory content moderation practices, a desideratum which the founding of the fanfiction platform _Archive of Our Own_ aimed to address (astolat, Lothian, Fiesler and Dym). The archive, conceptualised as a fan-run non-profit and situated in the broader context of the _Organization for Transformative Works_, is both manifestation and continuous (re-)creation of common fanfiction principles, such as gift giving, exchanges and paratexts, but also more abstract values like tolerance and diversity (Lothian and Stanfill). As part of this paratext, the archive allows readers to filter stories through a variety of tags. Not only may a reader thus look for or avoid specific plots, tropes or themes, authors may comment on and situate their stories within an extensive metatext (Leavenworth). On the flip side, the _Archive of Our Own_ lacks a filter for racist content, whereas erotic content featuring underage characters, rape or graphic descriptions of violence may be filtered out via the platform’s standardised warning categories. Despite the understanding of fandoms to be inherently predisposed to progressive ideologies, racism and discrimination may be found in many of its community structures (Lothian and Stanfill; for further reading see Pande).
