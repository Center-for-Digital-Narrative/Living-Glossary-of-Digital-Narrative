## Explication

The number of elements contained in a literary game and the number of connections created by and between those elements can be hugely variable, thereby rendering the interchange between the ludic and the literary of utmost importance. As Montfort and Moulthrop (2003) said, literary games may derive their power from the play between their literary aspects and their nature as games. All this interplay makes for a nebulous definition of what precisely (if anything) defines a literary game; ergo, any working definition should be triangulated rather than pinpointed. To perform this triangulation, we must consider (1) what is literary about the game, (2) what is gamelike about the literature, and (3) where and how the reader—or, perhaps better, the player—shapes the connections between them.

Astrid Ensslin (2014) defines literary games as “a hybrid subgroup of creative media that has both readerly and playerly characteristics” (p.1). Although literary games existed long before electronic literature, e-lit’s propagation and facilitation of the ludic in text-based media expanded both the definition and the scope of literary games by introducing, including, and/or incubating hypertext, nonlinear narrative, interactive/generative texts, and the like. Because of each genre’s reliance on digital technologies, electronic literature and literary games blur the boundaries between “reader” and “player”—a situation that has become all but ubiquitous with the rise of video games, which are now studied as both media and literary objects. Indeed, the history of video games maps onto the history of e-lit in fascinating ways: “like other genres—including, importantly, novels and films—they began more as curiosities than as artistic media” (Coltrain & Ramsay, 2019, p. 43).

As an example of how one might decide whether a media artifact falls within the definition of “literary game,” let us consider Shelley Jackson’s hypertext novel Patchwork Girl. The literary aspects of Patchwork Girl are easy to find: it has long been designated a novel, and its connections to Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein are multitudinous to say the least. With so many Frankensteinian nodes and edges, Patchwork Girl can be said to be a “literary hypertext”, which David E. Millard (2020) identifies as “a subset of games, with a constrained set of mechanics based around textual lexia and link following, albeit with a history of pushing those boundaries with strange structures and alternative behaviours” (p.1). Anyone familiar with Patchwork Girl knows Jackson’s work is well-situated as a ludic hypertext in addition to being a literary one. There is no one way to read/play Patchwork Girl, and any number of readings can be stitched together as the reader interacts with the writing. And Jackson performs a particularly adept suturing of “reader” and “player” early in the graveyard section found first on Patchwork Girl’s title page. Upon clicking out of the {headstone} lexia, the reader is transported to the {out} lexia, which immediately changes perspective and reads “Burdened with body parts, your fingernails packed with mud and chips of bone, you slink out of the graveyard. A kind of resurrection has taken place.” This is a fantastic (in both senses of the word) point of view in/from which to write—it could be anyone: the reader, Jackson, Shelley, Patchwork Girl, or multiple someones else. Regardless of who the author is at this point, the reader has been carried into the story in an almost movie-like (or cutscene-esque) way that includes an establishing shot (the graveyard), a closeup (the headstone), and finally a from-the-grave first-person point of view wherein the resurrected creature/reader becomes both Patchwork Girl and a reader-creature hybrid capable of writing its own story. By so doing, Jackson and Patchwork Girl offer us the reader/player enmeshment that can be triangulated with the literary and ludic elements of the text to classify Patchwork Girl as a literary game.

Whatever form it takes, a literary game does not exist in a vacuum. And, as Clara Fernández-Vara (2014) wrote, “When we analyze games, we study meaning within the game (meaningful play) and around it (cultural significance). The text is not limited to the work itself, but also to where the text is interpreted and by whom” (p. 6). Labeling a media artifact a “literary game” is largely an exercise in symbolism, but the possibilities inherent in the coupling of the ludic and the literary fit well within the porous confines of electronic literature.
