## Explication 

Combinatory text generation pre-dates electronic literature. From the Latin poet Porphyrius Optatianus in the 4th century, to the medieval theologian Ramon Llull, to Oulipian experiments in constraint (such as Georges Perec’s 1969 lipogrammatic novel La Disparition, which does not use the letter "e"), literature has a long history of formalized procedures that blur the boundary between algorithm and author. Or indeed the boundary between machine and author; John Clark’s 19th century Latin Verse Machine, for example, generated lines of Latin hexameter via an ingenious mechanical system of pulleys, levers, and cogs. 

Computational combinatory text generation is broadly similar to its pre-digital predecessors, with the main difference being that it is a computer, as opposed to a person or a mechanism, that arranges or permutes the chosen constitutive elements. Although it is important not to conflate electronic literature with combinatorial procedures, pioneering literary experiments with computers, such as Christopher Strachey’s love letter generator (1952), or Theo Lutz’s Stochastiche Texte (1959), are explicitly combinatorial in their procedural transformations of source texts. The former, for example, generates love letters by inserting a randomly selected element from a list of romantic words into an empty slot within a syntactic template (such as "You are my [adjective] [noun]"). The latter enacts a similar alliance of semantic randomness and syntactic determinism, though the very different textual output (Lutz’s source text is Franz Kafka’s novel The Castle) demonstrates the major effect that a human programmer can have on computational combination simply by curating the elements to be combined. These early examples of literary computation set the tone for many subsequent works of electronic literature; as Philippe Bootz and Christopher Funkhouser write, "until the 1980s most works of digital poetry were combinatorial generators" (2014, 83). 

Following advances in personal computing and the sea change of the internet, electronic combinatorial literature receded into the background as poets explored the kinetic, multimedial, and networked possibilities afforded by new technologies. These same technologies, however, also significantly increase the number of combinations that an algorithm can instantiate, and some writers have continued to produce combinatorial work. For example, Nick Montfort and Stephanie Strickland’s electronic poem Sea and Spar Between (2010) algorithmically combines and recombines a small set of words drawn from works by Herman Melville and Emily Dickinson to produce an ocean of text populated by some 225 trillion stanzas. In doing so, they exemplify the potential of computation to radically accentuate and dramatize a set of questions that are naturally raised by combinatorial literature: can an algorithm be an author? What kind of affectual or aesthetic impact, if any, can a mere procedure have on a reader? How can we interpret a system of combinatorial production when the number of possible combinations exceeds the cognitive capacities of a human reader? Is language itself just a database?
