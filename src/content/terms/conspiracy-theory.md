Conspiracy theories are commonly understood as beliefs that a group secretly collaborates for harmful or deceitful goals, relying on selective reasoning, mistrust of authorities, and the assumption that hidden forces manipulate reality for their own gain (Bale). They seek to provide alternative perspectives and new hypotheses to interpret reality and can be considered myths that can mobilize people to form new groups in an attempt to create the social orders they want (Maly). As narratives, they consist of plots—sequences of events that hinge on at least one temporal juncture, a shift in time that links events—and blend fictive with non-fictive discourses (Mason, 4).

Conspiracy theories are as old as civilization itself. The most well-known conspiracy theories include the ones prompted by events like the shooting of John F. Kennedy in 1962 and the attacks on the Twin Towers and Pentagon in Manhattan on September 11, 2001. The internet, and especially Web 2.0, has made them particularly pervasive as meaning-making practices shaped by digital infrastructures and networked participation. This form of narrative relies on participatory and fragmented discourse and intertextual connections. Increasingly, hybrid narratives mix fictional and non-fictional elements, making it difficult to determine genre and intent. Algorithmic media amplify online discourse, which is decontextualized, often anonymous, and expressed through multiple modalities such as text, image, audio, and video, making authenticity harder to assess. Some conspiracy theories originate as acts of trolling but gain traction online, while others are created with genuine conviction (Mason).

The rise of AI and deepfakes further complicates the ability to discern whether a speaker is deliberately lying, being sincere, ironic, trolling, or simply confused. AI chatbots based on large language models (LLMs) can interact with conspiracy theories in complex ways: when prompted, they may unreflectively present conspiratorial claims as factual, especially if the model has encountered these narratives widely online. Efforts, both legal and technical, are underway to mitigate this risk. These include content moderation guidelines, disclaimers, and algorithmic interventions designed to prevent AI from amplifying demonstrably false claims (Romanishyn et al.).

These challenges are not hypothetical. The notorious “Pizzagate” conspiracy gained widespread attention in 2016 due to its real-world consequences. Originating on 4chan, it suggested that a child trafficking ring, run by members of the Democratic Party, was operating out of a Washington D.C. pizza parlor. A month later, a man entered the restaurant armed with an AR-15 assault rifle, believing he was there to rescue child victims. He fired three shots before being arrested and later justified his actions by stating he was conducting his own investigation into the conspiracy (see Tuters et al.).

Beyond extreme cases like Pizzagate, conspiracy narratives thrive in broader cultural contexts where fan communities and subcultures perceive the world as layered with hidden meanings. Conspiracy narratives also pervade fandom. The #FreeBritney movement scrutinized Britney Spears’ conservatorship. ‘Swifties’ are devoted to decoding the many “easter eggs” their idol Taylor Swift puts in her videos, lyrics, and appearances. Amber Heard’s defamation trial (2022), P Diddy’s 2024 arrest, and Kate Middleton’s public absence (2024) also fueled wild speculations, whereas K-pop group BTS and Beyoncé have been linked to the Illuminati or ‘New World Order’. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argued that “protocols of unveiling have become the common currency of cultural and historical studies” (Sedgwick, 143). Today, this attitude defines media culture at large. This search for hidden meanings is fundamentally hermeneutic, involving interpretation and the uncovering of underlying significance (Van de Ven and Chateau).

Just as audiences decode hidden meanings in real-world conspiracies and celebrity culture, fictional narratives invite similar interpretative labor. Films, TV series, games, and works of electronic literature employ conspiratorial storytelling. often mirroring classical detective fiction in which protagonists investigate mysteries that expand as new information emerges (Fenster 2008). Post-network series such as _The X-Files_, _Lost_, and _Stranger Things_ engage audiences in a mode of spectatorship that mirrors conspiracy theorizing, encouraging close attention to formal aspects, plot twists, and diegetic events. As Mittell (35) notes, complex TV series provide “cognitive workouts”, honing problem-solving and observational skills, while Brinker (4) emphasizes the significant time and effort these interpretative communities demand, setting a high threshold for media literacy and information-processing.

Together, these dynamics illustrate how conspiracy narratives, from real-world to fictional, shape how audiences interpret, evaluate, and engage with information in an increasingly mediated and participatory culture.
