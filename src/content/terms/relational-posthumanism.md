title: Relational Posthumanism
description: "Relational Posthumanism is a philosophical stance that emphasizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of all forms of life, human and non-human, as well as the inanimate, within the technological, biological, and cultural spheres. It challenges anthropocentric views by advocating for a more holistic understanding of beings in relation to each other and the environment, recognizing the impact of technology on these relationships."
