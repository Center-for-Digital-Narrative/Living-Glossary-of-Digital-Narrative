Instapoetry is the name given to a form of poetry which is circulated and read on social media platforms, primarily Instagram but also others like Twitter and Tumblr. On such platforms, poetry is consciously designed for circulation, resulting in a distinct literary and visual aesthetic. Instapoems are usually short, comprising a single stanza of four to six sentences with frequent line breaks; they are written in free verse and they often contain a complementary visual component.

A fairly contemporary literary sub-genre, Instapoetry emerged in the early 21st century when figures like Rupi Kaur and Lang Leave began sharing their poems on Instagram and acquired a massive fan-following. Their popularity led to a resurgence of interest in poetry as a genre: specifically, published poetry collections authored by Instapoets regularly occupied the top positions on bestseller lists. Thematically, Instapoetry often deals with issues of personal experience, pain, and trauma that are reminiscent of self-help narratives. They espouse an aesthetic of minimalism as they employ simple and sparse language and imagery. Rupi Kaur is one of the most famous Instapoets; she has close to 4.3 million followers on Instagram and her published collections of poetry including Milk and Honey and Sun and her Flowers reached the top of bestseller lists.

The popularity of Instapoetry sparked a lot of debate about its perceived lack of merit. It was ill-received by literary critics who denounced it as a base and commercialized form of poetry which is turning a noble art form into a mechanized industry (Bucknell 2020, Watts 2018). In a deeply critical essay, Rebecca Watts, an acclaimed poet, declared that such "artless poetry" (13) is characterized by a "denigration of intellectual engagement and rejection of craft" (13) and depends instead on a "cult of personality" (14). Similarly, popular literary publications also attacked Instapoetry (Leszkiewicz) and called it "cliched, banal, derivative, portentous, repetitive and manipulative" (Hodgkinson, n.p.). Watts' essay triggered a series of responses which deemed her stance elitist. For instance, poet and researcher Katie Ailes argues that the qualities of honesty and authenticity which have become synonymous with Instapoetry deserve to be studied without condescension. Over the years, research around Instapoetry has diversified as scholars have debated its inclusion under the tag of e-literature (Berens) while others like JuEunhae Knox have studied it as the site of interactions between digital activism, algorithmic gatekeeping and commercialism.

While Instapoetry is a global phenomenon and a sizable part of it is written in English, there are more language and country specific variations of Instapoetry that have evolved over the years. Such poetry often incorporates local experiences and comments on contextualised political and socio-cultural issues.
