## I. Explication

A form of poetry which is circulated and read on social media platforms, primarily Instagram but also others like Twitter and Tumblr. On such platforms, poetry is consciously designed for circulation, resulting in a distinct literary and visual aesthetic. Instapoems are usually short, comprising a single stanza of four to six sentences with frequent line breaks; they are written in free verse and they often contain a complementary visual component.

A fairly contemporary literary sub-genre, Instapoetry emerged in the early 21st century when figures like Rupi Kaur and Lang Leave began sharing their poems on Instagram and acquired a massive fan-following. Their popularity led to a resurgence of interest in poetry as a genre: specifically, published poetry collections authored by Instapoets regularly occupied the top positions on bestseller lists. Thematically, Instapoetry often deals with issues of personal experience, pain, trauma that are reminiscent of self-help narratives. They espouse an aesthetic of minimalism as they employ simple and sparse language and imagery.

The popularity of Instapoetry sparked a lot of debate about its perceived lack of merit. It was ill-received by literary critics who denounced it as a base and commercialized form of poetry which is turning a noble art form into a mechanized industry. In a deeply critical essay, Rebecca Watts, an acclaimed poet, declared that such “artless poetry” is characterized by a “denigration of intellectual engagement and rejection of craft” and depends instead on a “cult of personality” (Watts 2018). Similarly, popular literary publications also attacked Instapoetry and called it “cliched, banal, derivative, portentous, repetitive and manipulative” (Hodgkinson 2019). Watts’ essay triggered a series of responses which deemed her stance elitist. For instance, Katie Ailes argues that the qualities of honesty and authenticity which have become synonymous with Instapoetry deserve to be studied without condescension.  At the same time, scholars also maintain that Instapoetry has emerged as a fertile ground to study the interactions between digital activism, algorithmic gatekeeping and commercialism (Knox 2023).
