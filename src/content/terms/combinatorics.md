## Explication

In electronic literature, “combinatorics” (more frequently encountered in adjectival form, as in, for example, the phrase “combinatory text generation”) also refers to satisfying arrangements of elements of finite sets. The difference, of course, is that the elements in question are typically linguistic, as opposed to numeric. And this way, the electronic arrangement and disarrangement of literary text often lies in the subversion of conventional conditions of genre, language, and style. 

Combinatory text generation pre-dates electronic literature. From the Latin poet Porphyrius Optatianus in the 4th century, to the medieval theologian Ramon Llull, to the algorithmic whimsy of Oulipo, the long history of combinatorial text generation is composed of a variety of elements, which means, fittingly, that that history can be permuted and combined in several different configurations. The most recent configuration, electronic combinatory literature, is basically coeval with electronic literature itself: pioneering literary experiments with computers, such as Theo Lutz’s Stochastiche Texte (1959), were explicitly combinatorial in their procedural transformations of source texts. These experiments set the tone for many subsequent works of electronic literature; as Philippe Bootz and Christopher Funkhouser write, “until the 1980s most works of digital poetry were combinatorial generators” (2014, 83).

Following advances in personal computing and the sea change of the internet, electronic combinatorial literature has receded into the background as poets explored the kinetic, multimedial, and networked possibilities afforded by new technologies. These same technologies, however, also significantly increase the number of actual combinations that an algorithm can generate, and some writers have continued to produce combinatorial work. For example, Nick Montfort and Stephanie Strickland’s electronic poem Sea and Spar Between (2010) algorithmically combines and recombines a small set of words drawn from works by Herman Melville and Emily Dickinson to produce an ocean of text populated by some 225 trillion stanzas. In doing so, they exemplify the potential of computation to radically accentuate and dramatize a set of questions that are naturally raised by combinatorial literature: can an algorithm be an author? What kind of affectual or aesthetic impact, if any, can an instantiated procedure have on a reader? Is language itself just a database?
