title: Surveillance Capitalism
description: "Surveillance Capitalism is an economic system centered around the commodification of personal data with the core purpose of profit-making. It involves the collection, analysis, and sale of data gathered from the public through internet activity and connected devices, often without explicit consent. This practice has profound implications for privacy, autonomy, and social norms, as corporations and governments leverage this data for advertising, influence, and control."
