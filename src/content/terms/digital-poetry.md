While Theo Lutz’s 1959 stochastic experiment on a Zuse Z22 computer is often credited as the first digital poem (Lutz 1959; cf. Funkhouser 37), the term “digital poetry” itself did not enter critical discourse until several decades later. As poetic experimentation evolved alongside advances in digital technology, a wide array of labels emerged in an effort to define these technology-dependent poetic practices. Among them were “computer poetry” (1959, 1960, 1962), “virtual poetry” or “vpoem” (1995), “cyberpoetry” (1996), “electronic poetry” or “e-poetry” (1996), “interpoetry” (1997/1998), etc., (for a more extensive catalogue of what Jorge Luis Antonio terms “various names for digital poetry”, see Antonio). These early efforts reflect a broader attempt to distinguish poetry created for and through digital media from both pre-digital literary forms and other types of electronic writing. 

Although the definition of “digital poetry” continues to evolve, there is general agreement that this phenomenon cannot be reduced to a singular genre or form. Rather, the phrase “digital poetry” is most commonly used as an umbrella term encompassing what C.T. Funkhouser succinctly describes as “a conglomeration of forms that now constitutes a genre even though the creative activity itself – in terms of its media, methods, and expressive intent – contains heterogeneous components” (Funkhouser 1; cf. Friedrich W. Block et al. 13; Rettberg 118). Some of the intersecting practices it is seen to include are (cf. Strehovec): kinetic/animated poetry (e.g., bpNichol’s collection *First Screening: Computer Poems* 1984), code poetry (e.g., Mez Breeze’s collection *Human Readable Messages: [Mezangelle 2003–2011]* 2011), poetry generators (e.g., John Cayley’s poem “The Speaking Clock” 1995), and interactive poetry (e.g., Jim Rosenberg’s *Intergrams* 1993). Other examples include digital sound poetry (e.g., Jörg Piringer’s poem “80x25,” n.d.), ergodic/visual digital poetry (e.g., Lionel Kearns’s “Birth of God/uniVerse” 1965), and digital textscapes/installations with poetic features (e.g., Nalini Malani’s installation *In Search of Vanished Blood* 2012). As evolving as its definition, digital poetry itself is often regarded as a “process” both in diachronic terms of its ongoing engagement with changing computerised techniques (Funkhouser 1–2) and in synchronic terms of its ontological dependence as an “event” on the hardware and software needed to execute a specific digital poem (Hayles 181–182).  

As such, digital poetry has inspired two main critical approaches, often used in tandem. The first wishes to establish a broader literary lineage and to explain the characteristics of digital poetry through its continuities with earlier literary traditions: for example, the ancient rhetorical practice of ekphrasis, an exercise aimed at engaging the audience’s imagination through vivid, descriptive language (Lindhé), concrete poetry (Stefans), language poetry (Glazier), or premodernist, modernist, and postmodernist techniques in general (Funkhouser 10–18). The second, rooted in the broader field of electronic literature, foregrounds the importance of media-specific analysis and the unique affordances of digital environments in which these works are produced and experienced (Hayles 2006, Rettberg). 

Despite the rise of “digital poetry” as the dominant term in the field, alternative labels such as “computer poetry”, “cyberpoetry”, “e-poetry”, and the broader concept of “digital poetics” that avoids affirming “digital poetry” as a distinct category, remain in circulation and testify both to the field’s heterogeneous origins and the continuous lack of a fully settled critical lexicon (Funkhouser 22). Additionally, current critical discourse makes an important distinction between studies of digital poetry and studies of poetry in the digital age. The latter often explores both digital and digitised poetry, i.e. poetry that is neither born-digital nor fully technology-dependent and tends to circulate across digital and analog formats (Benthien, Matter et al., Stein).
