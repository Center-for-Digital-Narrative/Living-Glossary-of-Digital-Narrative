## I. What is an Antogonist?
In a story, the antagonist (pronounced an-TAG-oh-nist) is the opposite of the protagonist, or main character. Typically, this is a villain of some kind, but not always! It’s just the opponent of the main character, or someone who gets in their way.

Every story has at least one protagonist, but not all stories have an antagonist! In some cases, the protagonist is simply struggling against impersonal forces like nature, circumstance, social strictures, or addiction. In these cases, there is no antagonist in the story. However, a story can have any number of antagonists getting in the protagonist’s way.

## II. Examples and Explanation
### Example 1
> Adolph Hitler (World History)

The dictator has appeared as an antagonist in countless stories, both fictional and non-fictional, over the past few generations. In re-tellings of the Second World War, the Allies are almost always the heroes, making Hitler the villainous antagonist.

### Example 2
> Homer Simpson (the Simpsons)

If Homer  is the protagonist of The Simpsons, then he has many antagonists, some of them evil and others less so. His wife Marge, for example, is often out to stop his plans – not because she is a villain, but because she fears for his safety or the family’s reputation. But when she obstructs Homer’s goals, she is still acting as an antagonist (though neither a hero nor a villain).

### Example 3
> Ozymandias (Watchmen)

For most of the graphic novel, the protagonists are uncertain who their antagonist is. Some mysterious figure is plotting against them, but no one knows who it is. In the end, it turns out that the antagonist is Ozymandias, a brilliant retired superhero. Ozymandias causes millions of deaths, but he also averts World War Three and ends the Cold War, thus arguably saving millions more lives. Because Ozymandias is still a superhero, and because his plan is in such a moral grey area, this is a debatable example of a hero antagonist.

## III. Types of Protagonist
### a. Villain
Most antagonists are traditional villains – they’re “the bad guy” and are motivated in some way by evil. The most interesting villains have believable motives for their actions, but sometimes the villain is just pure evil and wants nothing more than to kill and destroy for no particular reason.

### b. Hero Antagonist
Sometimes, the entire story is told from the perspective of the villain, and thus the hero becomes the antagonist. This is less common than traditional villains, but it can make for a very interesting story!
