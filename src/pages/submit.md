## Entry Guidelines

The Living Glossary of Digital Narrative (LGDN) is a collaborative project between the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and the Center for Digital Narrative at the University of Bergen, Norway. The project is spearheaded by Joseph Tabbi and Hannah Ackermans.

The aim of the LGDN project is to produce an online terminology base for disciplines related to the crafting and study of born digital narratives. Rather than a book written by one person or a small team, the Glossary is a living document, publishing entries that are written by a variety of authors across career stages, affiliations, and industries. Writing a glossary entry is a useful research exercise that results in **a peer-reviewed publication** serving the wider community.

## Taxonomy of an LGDN Entry
Glossary entries are composed of four separate sections:

1. **Definition**, which describes the term in a single phrase.
2. **Explication**, which provides a reflective description of the term and includes references.
3. **See Also**, which provides suggestions for related terms also listed in the Glossary.
4. **Bibliography**, containing all works referenced in the entry and further reading suggested by the entry author, should they wish to provide some.

## Overview of Entry Sections

### Definitions
Definitions are **brief explanations**, each one consisting of **a single phrase**, that specify the **most commonly accepted use(s) of a term**.

Most of the definitions within the Glossary will be selected and authored by the LGDN editorial team.
Contributors are encouraged to **select a term from the editorial teams list of pre-approved terms, which have definitions already available in the glossary**. You may, however, apply with your own term and a corresponding definition, which will then be reviewed by the editorial team. Definitions should not start with an indefinite article (a, an).

### Explications
Explications are the focus of contributions and are **in-depth, encyclopaedic descriptions** of a term. Explications are expected to be around **300-700 words** in length. If you exceed this word limit, indicate your wordcount when you submit, and the team will decide if revision is needed. An explication **must include references**. References should be **formatted in MLA style** <style.mla.org>.

Explications are expected to be **written in a neutral manner**, covering the most popular understandings of the term. We would appreciate those who are writing about a term they have coined to include other people s interpretations of it. Examples should be provided within scholarly and, where applicable, creative contexts. Explications **may cover topics like the term s evolution and history, previous or ongoing academic discussions, and any varying interpretations**.

Inclusion of links to other Glossary entries within explications is encouraged.
**All explications must be original texts**. We will not accept replications of texts from pre-existing, published sources or combinations thereof.

**The entry may be written in any English dialect (British, American, Indian, etc.) so long as the dialect is consistent throughout**.

### See Also
The See Also section is a list of hyperlinked, related terms that lead to other entries within the Glossary. Where possible, these should have already been incorporated into the explication text. **Hyperlinks should be indicated by the use of double square brackets around the intended link term, as so: `[[hyperlink]]`**. The Glossary website contains a list of all current terms. Entry authors may also provide terms not yet listed in the Glossary, which will be taken as recommendations for inclusion.

### Bibliography
The entry bibliography should be **formatted in MLA style** and is split into **two sections**:

* **Works Referenced**
  * Works that have been referenced within the explication
* **Further Reading**
  * Recommended resources that can further expand a readers knowledge of the term and topic
