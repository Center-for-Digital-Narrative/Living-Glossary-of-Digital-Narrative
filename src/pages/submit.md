## Contribute to the Glossary

Do you work with digital narrative, electronic literature, or interactive fiction? Help us build a shared resource for researchers, creators, and students worldwide.

The Living Glossary of Digital Narrative (LGDN) is a peer-reviewed, academic glossary dedicated to the evolving language of born-digital narratives. Your entry will not only help define key concepts but also become a **citable publication** benefiting the wider academic and creative community.

Unlike static reference books, the living glossary grows through contributions from experts across disciplines and career stages. No matter your background, your expertise can help shape the way digital narrative is understood. Browse our guidelines below to see how you can contribute, or suggest a term you think belongs in the Glossary.

## Taxonomy of an LGDN Entry

Glossary entries are composed of four separate sections:

1. **Definition**, which describes the term in a single phrase.
2. **Explication**, which provides a reflective description of the term and includes references.
3. **See Also**, which provides suggestions for related terms also listed in the Glossary.
4. **Bibliography**, containing all works referenced in the entry and further reading suggested by the entry author, should they wish to provide some.

## Overview of Entry Sections

### Definitions

Definitions are **brief explanations**, consisting of **a single phrase**, that specifies the **most commonly accepted use(s) of a term**.

Most of the definitions within the Glossary will be selected and authored by the LGDN editorial team.

Contributors are encouraged to **select a term from the editorial team’s list of preapproved terms**. You may, however, apply with your own term and a definition, which will then be reviewed by the editorial team.

### Explications

Explications are the focus of contributions and are **in-depth, encyclopaedic descriptions** of a term. Explications are expected to be around **300-700 words** in length. If you exceed this word limit, indicate your wordcount when you submit, and the team will decide if revision is needed. An explication **must include references**. References and in-text citations must be formatted in MLA style.

Explications are expected to be written in a neutral manner and will provide examples of the term in use within scholarly and, where applicable, creative contexts. Explications may cover topics like the term’s evolution and history, any previous or ongoing academic discussions surrounding the term, and any varying interpretations.

Inclusion of links to other Glossary entries within explications is encouraged.

**All explications must be original texts**. We will not accept replications of texts from pre-existing, published sources or combinations thereof.

### See Also

The ‘See Also’ section is a list of hyperlinked, related terms that will lead to other entries within the Glossary. Where possible, these should have already been incorporated into the explication text.

### Bibliography

The entry bibliography should be formatted in MLA style and is split into **two sections**:

* **Works referenced**
  * Works that have been referenced within the explication
* **Further reading**
  * Recommended resources that can further expand a reader’s knowledge of the term and topic
