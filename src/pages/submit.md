## Entry Guidelines

The Living Glossary of Digital Narrative (LGDN) is a collaborative project between the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and the Center for Digital Narrative at the University of Bergen, Norway. The project is spearheaded by Joseph Tabbi, Hannah Ackermans, and Colin Robinson.

The aim of the LGDN project is to produce and online terminology base for disciplines related to the crafting and study of born digital narratives. Rather than a book written by one person or a small team, the Glossary will be a living document, publishing entries that are written by a variety of authors across career stages, affiliations, and industries. Writing a glossary entry is a useful research exercise that results in **a peer-reviewed publication** serving the wider community. 

## Taxonomy of an LGDN Entry

Glossary entries are composed of four separate sections:

1. **Definition**, which describes the term in a single phrase.
2. **Explication**, which provides a reflective description of the term and includes
   references.
3. **See Also**, which provides suggestions for related terms also listed in the
   Glossary.
4. **Bibliography**, containing all works referenced in the entry and further reading
   suggested by the entry author, should they wish to provide some

## Overview of Entry Sections

### Definitions

Definitions are **brief explanations**, consisting of **a single phrase**, that specifies the **most commonly accepted use(s) of a term**.

Most of the definitions within the Glossary will be selected and authored by the LGDN editorial team.

Contributors are encouraged to **select a term from the editorial team’s list of preapproved terms**. You may, however, apply with your own term and a definition, which will then be reviewed by the editorial team.

### Explications

Explications are the focus of contributions and are **in-depth, encyclopaedic descriptions** of a term. Explications are expected to be around **300-700 words** in length. If you exceed this word limit, indicate your wordcount when you submit, and the team will decide if revision is needed. An explication **must include references**. References should be formatted in MLA style.

Explications are expected to be written in a neutral manner and will provide examples of the term in use within scholarly and, where applicable, creative contexts. Explications may cover topics like the term’s evolution and history, any previous or ongoing academic discussions surrounding the term, and any varying interpretations.

Inclusion of links to other Glossary entries within explications is encouraged.

**All explications must be original texts**. We will not accept replications of texts from pre-existing, published sources or combinations thereof.

### See Also

The ‘See Also’ section is a list of hyperlinked, related terms that will lead to other entries within the Glossary. Where possible, these should have already been incorporated into the explication text. Entry authors may provide in this list terms not yet in the Glossary, which will be taken as recommendations for inclusion

### Bibliography

The entry bibliography should be formatted in MLA style and is split into **two sections**:

* **Works referenced**
  * Works that have been referenced within the explication
* **Further reading**
  * Recommended resources that can further expand a reader’s knowledge of the term and topic
