description: 'A "Cliffhanger" is a narrative device often used at the end of a story segment that leaves the audience in a heightened state of suspense or uncertainty. It refers to an unresolved and crucial moment, usually at the conclusion of a chapter, episode, or season, where the fate of the characters or the outcome of the plot is left hanging.'

## I. What is a Cliffhanger?

A **cliffhanger** is when a story or plotline ends suddenly or a large plot twist occurs and is left unresolved. It is a device that is used to cause suspense, but most importantly, it leaves unanswered questions that make the reader or viewer want to come back to learn what will happen. The phrase comes from the idea of “hanging off a cliff”—whatever happens will determine the character’s future and the story’s plot, leaving audiences “on the edge” of knowing. Cliffhangers are a particularly popular and widely used device in television, whose success relies heavily on audiences returning to watch week after week with episodes that are “to be continued.”

## II. Example of a Cliffhanger

Read the following short passage:

> The man stood on the end of the platform, looking down at the still turquoise water ten meters below. He had worked towards this his whole life. He wasn’t nervous, even though what would happen in the next few moments—few seconds—would determine his future. But he was as tranquil as the water below. He arched his heels, balancing on the balls of his feet; his arms extended above him into the perfect point. He filled his lungs with air and closed his eyes for only a fraction of a second, and when they opened, he exhaled calmly, and dove.

The passage above leaves one huge question unanswered—how did the diver perform? We wonder, what will happen if he fails? If he succeeds? Each possibility creates further questions for readers to consider, and in turn, we are likely to continue reading to get answers.

## III. Importance of Cliffhangers

Cliffhangers are a crucial tool for storytelling because they encourage people to come back for each new segment, for example, a TV show’s weekly episode. A show or book series is successful if the audience is interested in the plotline, because then they will want to keep watching or reading. Thus, so long as a cliffhanger creates questions, fans will want answers.
