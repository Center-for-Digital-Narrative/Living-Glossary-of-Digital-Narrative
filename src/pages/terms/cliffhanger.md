## I. What is a Cliffhanger?

A **cliffhanger** is when a story or plotline ends suddenly or a large plot twist occurs and is left unresolved. It is a device that is used to cause suspense, but most importantly, it leaves unanswered questions that make the reader or viewer want to come back to learn what will happen. The phrase comes from the idea of “hanging off a cliff”—whatever happens will determine the character’s future and the story’s plot, leaving audiences “on the edge” of knowing. Cliffhangers are a particularly popular and widely used device in television, whose success relies heavily on audiences returning to watch week after week with episodes that are “to be continued.”

## II. Example of a Cliffhanger

Read the following short passage:

> The man stood on the end of the platform, looking down at the still turquoise water ten meters below. He had worked towards this his whole life. He wasn’t nervous, even though what would happen in the next few moments—few seconds—would determine his future. But he was as tranquil as the water below. He arched his heels, balancing on the balls of his feet; his arms extended above him into the perfect point. He filled his lungs with air and closed his eyes for only a fraction of a second, and when they opened, he exhaled calmly, and dove.

The passage above leaves one huge question unanswered—how did the diver perform? We wonder, what will happen if he fails? If he succeeds? Each possibility creates further questions for readers to consider, and in turn, we are likely to continue reading to get answers.

## III. Importance of Cliffhangers

Cliffhangers are a crucial tool for storytelling because they encourage people to come back for each new segment, for example, a TV show’s weekly episode. A show or book series is successful if the audience is interested in the plotline, because then they will want to keep watching or reading. Thus, so long as a cliffhanger creates questions, fans will want answers.

## IV. Examples of Cliffhangers in Literature

### Example 1

A very famous cliffhanger is still unresolved today from George R.R. Martin’s fantasy novel *A Dance with Dragons*, the fifth book in his *Song of Ice and Fire* series, which is also known by its HBO television series *Game of Thrones*. In fact, fans have been waiting for answers since the book’s release in 2011. The cliffhanger involves the well-loved character Jon Snow, whose fate is left unclear after the following passage:

> Then Bowen Marsh stood there before him, tears running down his cheeks. “For the Watch.” He punched Jon in the belly. When he pulled his hand away, the dagger stayed where he had buried it.
>
> Jon fell to his knees. He found the dagger’s hilt and wrenched it free. In the cold night air the wound was smoking. “Ghost,” he whispered. Pain washed over him. Stick them with the pointy end. When the third dagger took him between the shoulder blades, he gave a grunt and fell face-first into the snow. He never felt the fourth knife. Only the cold …

This is the last passage and chapter narrated from the point of view of Jon Snow, but; the book ends only a few chapters later. So, this leaves an ambiguous ending for the audience—is Jon Snow dead, or does he survive? Fans are still waiting for the next book of the *Song of Ice and Fire* series; in fact, the Internet is full of theories about this cliffhanger and Jon Snow’s fate.

## Example 2

Marvel Comics’ The *Spectacular Spider-Girl* often features stories that are “to be concluded” in the next issue; a commonly used technique in comic book series. They end in the midst of major action, usually with Spider Girl stuck in a dangerous situation.
