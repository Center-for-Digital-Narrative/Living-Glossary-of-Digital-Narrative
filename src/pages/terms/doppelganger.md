## I. What is a Doppelganger?
Doppelganger (DOPP-el-gang-er) comes from a German word meaning “double-walker.” It’s a twin or double of some character, usually in the form of an evil twin.

There are countless evil twins in soap operas and other TV melodramas. They sometimes impersonate a main character or cause confusion among the love interests. Although this plot device has become a bit of a cliché, it is an excellent example of the doppelganger concept.

## II. Examples of Doppelganger
### Example 1
There is an old mirror in this room. Your frightened reflection moves on its own. You realize it is you from another time. Your reflection writes on the mirror: THIS WILL HELP.

This is a card from the horror-themed board game “Betrayal at House on the Hill.” The doppelganger is not evil in this case, but helpful.

### Example 2
In Irish folklore, it was believed that one’s doppelganger (or “fetch” in Irish) was an evil omen. If you saw your fetch walking on the horizon, it meant something bad was about to happen to you.

## III. The Importance of Doppelgangers
Psychologically, doppelgangers seem to be extremely compelling to human beings – that’s why they appear so often in mythology, literature, and film. No one knows entirely why this is the case, but it might have something to do with autoscopy or “self-seeing.” This is a symptom of some mental illnesses, where a patient will see herself going about her day, as if from a distance. It’s an unnerving form of hallucination, but not terribly uncommon. The whole category of “out-of-body experiences” falls into this category as well.

In general, a doppelganger creates a creepy or eerie tone within a story, possibly because you see yourself from outside your own body. But sometimes writers will turn that creepiness on its head – a silly or incompetent doppelganger can be a great way to generate laughs.
