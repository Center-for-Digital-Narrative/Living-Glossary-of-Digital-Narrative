Moore",["Date","2025-03-14T00:00:00.000Z"],"## Explication \n\nCombinatory text generation pre-dates electronic literature. From the Latin poet Porphyrius Optatianus in the 4th century, to the medieval theologian Ramon Llull, to Oulipian experiments in constraint (such as Georges Perec’s 1969 lipogrammatic novel La Disparition, which does not use the letter \"e\"), literature has a long history of formalized procedures that blur the boundary between algorithm and author. Or indeed the boundary between machine and author; John Clark’s 19th century Latin Verse Machine, for example, generated lines of Latin hexameter via an ingenious mechanical system of pulleys, levers, and cogs. \n\nComputational combinatory text generation is broadly similar to its pre-digital predecessors, with the main difference being that it is a computer, as opposed to a person or a mechanism, that arranges or permutes the chosen constitutive elements. Although it is important not to conflate electronic literature with combinatorial procedures, pioneering literary experiments with computers, such as Christopher Strachey’s 1952 love letter generator, or Theo Lutz’s 1959 Stochastiche Texte, are explicitly combinatorial in their procedural transformations of source texts. The former, for example, generates love letters by inserting a randomly selected element from a list of romantic words into an empty slot within a syntactic template (such as \"You are my [adjective] [noun]\"). The latter enacts a similar alliance of semantic randomness and syntactic determinism, though the very different textual output (Lutz’s source text is Franz Kafka’s novel The Castle) demonstrates the major effect that a human programmer can have on computational combination simply by curating the elements to be combined. These early examples of literary computation set the tone for many subsequent works of electronic literature; as Philippe Bootz and Christopher Funkhouser write, \"until the 1980s most works of digital poetry were combinatorial generators\" (83). \n\nFollowing advances in personal computing and the sea change of the internet, electronic combinatorial literature receded into the background as poets explored the kinetic, multimedial, and networked possibilities afforded by new technologies. These same technologies, however, also significantly increase the number of combinations that an algorithm can instantiate, and some writers have continued to produce combinatorial work. For example, Nick Montfort and Stephanie Strickland’s 2010 electronic poem Sea and Spar Between algorithmically combines and recombines a small set of words drawn from works by Herman Melville and Emily Dickinson to produce an ocean of text populated by some 225 trillion stanzas. In doing so, they exemplify the potential of computation to radically accentuate and dramatize a set of questions that are naturally raised by combinatorial literature: can an algorithm be an author? What kind of affectual or aesthetic impact, if any, can a mere procedure have on a reader? How can we interpret a system of combinatorial production when the number of possible combinations exceeds the cognitive capacities of a human reader? Is language itself just a database? \n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Referenced\n\nBootz, Philip, and Christopher Funkhouser. \"Combinatory and Automatic Text Generation.\" In *The Johns Hopkins Guide to Digital Media*, edited by Marie Laure Ryan, Lori Emerson, and Benjamin J.

posted on the Instagram social media platform, which is characterized by brief, visually appealing texts that often incorporate themes of personal identity, traumatic experiences, and emotional catharsis","Shweta Khilnani",["Date","2025-03-14T00:00:00.000Z"],"## Explication\n\nInstapoetry is the name given to a form of poetry which is circulated and read on social media platforms, primarily Instagram but also others like Twitter and Tumblr. On such platforms, poetry is consciously designed for circulation, resulting in a distinct literary and visual aesthetic. Instapoems are usually short, comprising a single stanza of four to six sentences with frequent line breaks; they are written in free verse and they often contain a complementary visual component. \n\nA fairly contemporary literary sub-genre, Instapoetry emerged in the early 21st century when figures like Rupi Kaur and Lang Leave began sharing their poems on Instagram and acquired a massive fan-following. Their popularity led to a resurgence of interest in poetry as a genre: specifically, published poetry collections authored by Instapoets regularly occupied the top positions on bestseller lists. Thematically, Instapoetry often deals with issues of personal experience, pain, and trauma that are reminiscent of self-help narratives. They espouse an aesthetic of minimalism as they employ simple and sparse language and imagery. Rupi Kaur is one of the most famous Instapoets; she has close to 4.3 million followers on Instagram and her published collections of poetry including Milk and Honey and Sun and her Flowers reached the top of bestseller lists.  \n\nThe popularity of Instapoetry sparked a lot of debate about its perceived lack of merit. It was ill-received by literary critics who denounced it as a base and commercialized form of poetry which is turning a noble art form into a mechanized industry (Bucknell 2020, Watts 2018). In a deeply critical essay, Rebecca Watts, an acclaimed poet, declared that such \"artless poetry\" (13) is characterized by a \"denigration of intellectual engagement and rejection of craft\" (13) and depends instead on a \"cult of personality\" (14). Similarly, popular literary publications also attacked Instapoetry (Leszkiewicz) and called it \"cliched, banal, derivative, portentous, repetitive and manipulative\" (Hodgkinson, n.p.). Watts' essay triggered a series of responses which deemed her stance elitist. For instance, poet and researcher Katie Ailes argues that the qualities of honesty and authenticity which have become synonymous with Instapoetry deserve to be studied without condescension. Over the years, research around Instapoetry has diversified as scholars have debated its inclusion under the tag of e-literature (Berens) while others like JuEunhae Knox have studied it as the site of interactions between digital activism, algorithmic gatekeeping and commercialism.  \n\nWhile Instapoetry is a global phenomenon and a sizable part of it is written in English, there are more language and country specific variations of Instapoetry that have evolved over the years. Such poetry often incorporates local experiences and comments on contextualised political and socio-cultural issues.\n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Referenced\n\nAiles, Katie. \"'Instapoetry' in the LRB:

Game","Media artifact that contains both ludic and literary elements","Calvin Olsen",["Date","2025-03-14T00:00:00.000Z"],"## Explication\n\nAstrid Ensslin defines literary games as \"a hybrid subgroup of creative media that has both readerly and playerly characteristics\" (1). Said another way, a literary game is a media artifact that contains elements of literature and gameplay. Ensslin’s definition builds on the work of Montfort and Moulthrop, who wrote that the power of literary games may derive from the play between their literary aspects and their nature as games. Think of Mad Libs or Exquisite Corpse, whose parameters are largely textual and whose end results are influenced by the decisions made by those playing. These are literary games at their most basic.\n\nLiterary games existed long before electronic literature, but e-lit’s propagation and facilitation of the ludic in text-based media expanded both the definition and the scope of literary games by introducing, including, and/or incubating hypertext, nonlinear narrative, interactive/generative texts, and the like. Because of each genre’s reliance on digital technologies, electronic literature and literary games blur the boundaries between \"reader\" and \"player\"—a situation that has become all but ubiquitous with the rise of video games, which are now studied as both media and literary objects. Indeed, the history of video games maps onto the history of e-lit in fascinating ways: \"like other genres—including, importantly, novels and films—they began more as curiosities than as artistic media\" (Coltrain and Ramsay, 43), though that does not necessarily mean all video games are literary games. Traditional video games often focus one gameplay and mechanics at the expense of narrative, while literary games are centered on verbal and textual components and interactivity.\n\nAs an example of how one might decide whether a media artifact falls within the definition of \"literary game,\" let us consider Shelley Jackson’s hypertext novel Patchwork Girl. The literary aspects of Patchwork Girl are easy to find: it has long been designated a novel, and its connections to Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein are multitudinous to say the least. Anyone familiar with Patchwork Girl knows Jackson’s work is well-situated as a ludic hypertext in addition to being a literary one. There is no one way to read/play Patchwork Girl, and any number of readings can be stitched together as the reader interacts with the writing. And Jackson performs a particularly adept suturing of \"reader\" and \"player\" early in the graveyard section found first on Patchwork Girl’s title page. Upon clicking out of the \\{headstone} lexia, the reader is transported to the \\{out} lexia, which immediately changes perspective and reads \"Burdened with body parts, your fingernails packed with mud and chips of bone, you slink out of the graveyard. A kind of resurrection has taken place.\" This is a fantastic (in both senses of the word) point of view in/from which to write—it could be anyone: the reader, Jackson, Shelley, Patchwork Girl, or multiple someones else. Regardless of who the author is at this point, the reader has been carried into the story in an almost movie-like (or cutscene-esque) way that includes an establishing shot (the graveyard), a closeup (the headstone), and finally a from-the-grave first-person point of view wherein the resurrected creature/reader becomes both Patchwork Girl and a reader-creature hybrid capable of writing its own story. By so doing, Jackson and Patchwork Girl offer us the reader/player enmeshment that can be triangulated with the literary and ludic elements of the text to classify Patchwork Girl as a literary game. It may not be a perfect fit in all places, but its reliance on interactive storytelling and the reader/player’s decision aligns well with Ensslin’s categorization.\n\nWhatever form it takes, a literary game does not exist in a vacuum. This is because, as Clara Fernández-Vara wrote, \"When we analyze games, we study meaning within the game (meaningful play) and around it (cultural significance). The text is not limited to the work itself, but also to where the text is interpreted and by whom\" (6). Labeling a media artifact a \"literary game\" is largely an exercise in symbolism, but the possibilities inherent in the coupling of the ludic and the literary fit well within the porous confines of electronic literature.\n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Referenced\n\nColtrain, James, and Stephen Ramsay. \"Can Video Games Be Humanities Scholarship?\" *Debates in the Digital Humanities 2019*, edited by Matthew K.

Dawkins proposed the term meme as an example of how a replicator could function in the same way as DNA. He defined it as the name for a \"new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation\" (249). The term was intended to rhyme with the word ‘gene’ and conveys a similar ability to be replicated and imitated. For Dawkins, this was a part of a \"larger effort to apply evolutionary theory to cultural change\" (Shifman 9). \n\nThe term became popular within the framework of digital or electronic texts, where it refers to any item such as a video, image or written text which is shared repeatedly by people on the internet, making it go ‘viral’ in the process. At the same time, people often modify or remix the content of such items, resulting in the production of countless derivatives which are socially, culturally and politically contextual. Due to these features, memes have been identified as key examples of postmodern digital poetics and third generation electronic literature (Flores).  \n\nOwing to their replicability and rapid circulation, memes are often studied within the rubric of participatory cultures in the digital realm. They are also characterized by their intertextuality as they refer to other memes and are embedded within a complex mesh of information and ideas. In the recent past, memes have played an instrumental role in the articulation of several digital narratives. For instance, memes were employed extensively during the 2016 US Presidential Elections to share grassroot political ideas (Moody-Ramirez and Church). They were also used extensively to shape popular digital narratives during the coronavirus pandemic (Saint Laurent et al.).  \n\nMemes have been studied as a \"secondary layer of language\" in digital spaces, engendering new forms of memetic participation (Shifman).

of pre-existing media or texts within a new work, often to critique, comment upon, or pay homage to the original source material","Barmina Polina",["Date","2025-09-24T00:00:00.000Z"],"## Explication\n\n_Appropriation_ involves reusing existing content — text, images, audio, or videos — and turning it into a different creation, such as \\[memes\\], remixes, and mashups. The term derives from the Latin word _appropriare,_ which means “to make one’s own”, from the Latin root _proprius,_ meaning “own,” the root of the word “property” (Rogers 475). The idea of appropriation has been common in art since the 1970s (Pichlmair 1). In the second half of the 20th century, appropriation art aimed to decontextualize the symbols of consumerism, such as brands, advertisements, and logos. Today, this practice is well-established in mass-production of cultural products and digital content, including films, electronic literature (e-lit), video games, etc.\n\n_Appropriation_ intersects with the term _adaptation_. Both terms are dependent on the established canons, whether in the realm of traditional literature or in the emerging field of digital narratives and are closely interrelated. However, adaptation usually signals a relationship with an informing source text either through its title or through more embedded references. Appropriation often transforms the original work into a different cultural product by adding elements or offering critique, which may result in a new genre (Sanders 35) or implicit collaboration (Skains 1). Appropriation is based on re-interpretation and implies comparative approaches and juxtaposing the initial work against a new creation. Such creations involve complex, layered, and hidden relationships with their source material compared to the more direct approach of a film adaptation of a well-known text.\n\nHistorically, appropriation is deeply rooted in postmodernism, where techniques such as pastiche, intertextuality, bricolage, and sampling have come to define aesthetic and textual strategies. Postmodern artists and writers had blurred the lines between high and low culture, originality and imitation, making appropriation a hallmark of postmodern expression and a method for questioning authenticity, authorship, and the stability of meaning.\n\nAmong problematic aspects of appropriation are the modern legal notions of copyright (homage, plagiarism), ethical questions, and cultural heritage preservation. The concept of “cultural appropriation”, intertwined with cultural politics, is often associated with the commodification of marginalized and/or colonized cultures (Rogers 474). It reconsiders the accessibility of art forms across different cultures, the issues of inclusion, and the questions of cross-cultural justice. Sinnreich et al. (2009) showed that the attitudes of audience toward appropriation depend upon the perception of commercialism and originality in the piece; if the work was appropriated for profit, or if the appropriated work was seen as copying rather than contributing something original, it was more likely to be seen as unethical.\n\nWith the rise of AI-generated content, remix culture on platforms like TikTok and YouTube, and the mass circulation of memes, the debates surrounding the ethics of appropriation, authorship, and originality have become even more complex. For example, Nicholas Carr argues that the digital environment’s emphasis on fragmentation and rapid consumption undermines the very depth of engagement with cultural works. He claims that in a digital age where users are encouraged to quickly consume and repurpose information, the practice of appropriation becomes shallow and loses its critical potential. Carr writes that the digital age promotes “cursory reading, hurried and distracted thinking, and superficial learning” (Carr 116), turning the act of appropriation into a surface-level interaction rather than a meaningful transformation. In contrast, Lev Manovich offers a more optimistic perspective. He highlights sampling, remixing, and database logic as fundamental features of new media, suggesting that digital artworks often emerge as compilations or recombinations of pre-existing cultural materials rather than entirely original creations. Manovich contends that creativity lies not in inventing entirely new elements, but in assembling existing objects in a new selection and sequence that makes the work original (Manovich 130). In a similar fashion, Jonathan Lethem defends appropriation, claiming that appropriation, imitation, quoting, referencing, and subtle collaboration are essential parts of creativity and appear in all forms and genres of cultural work (Lethem 61). He argues that appropriation, whether in traditional or digital forms, is a flow of shared ideas rather than a simple case of stealing.\n\nLawrence Lessig’s work on remix culture provides a key legal and ethical framework for understanding appropriation in the digital age. He argues that remixing—creatively reusing cultural content—is vital to modern cultural production and that digital technologies will reshape the way people access content (Lessig 72). Lessig critiques traditional copyright laws for conflicting with non-commercial creative practices and advocates for a more flexible legal approach that supports _free culture_.\n\nAs for the existing examples of appropriation works in the field of e-lit, Donna Leishman’s Red Riding Hood (2001) illustrates a postmodern shift toward minimalism and layered meanings through its reimagining of the classic fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood. While the basic plot elements remain similar (Red Riding Hood’s mother sends her to her grandmother with a basket, and she travels through the forest, meeting a boy, instead of a wolf), Leishman then updates the story to reflect contemporary issues (Almas 83). The modern appropriation questions traditional distinctions between good and evil, innocence and experience, highlighting a more nuanced and ambiguous portrayal of the characters.\n\nIn the medium of video games, a new media piece _PainStation (2001)_ exemplifies appropriation of art in two ways: it incorporates an intuitive reference to the Sony PlayStation (home video game console released in 1994) while also appropriating _Pong_ (table tennis–themed twitch arcade, 1972), one of the earliest video games. _PainStation_ is an interactive game where two players compete against each other, where losing points results in physical discomfort, such as heat, electric shocks, or whips, as controlled by the game’s feedback system, adding a unique and intense sensory dimension to gameplay_._ The game merges cultural concepts such as brands, merit, endurance, and competition and unites these elements into a single interactive art piece (Pichlmair 3).\n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Referenced\n\nAlmas, Neelum. \"Digital Appropriation of Children's Literature: A\nPostmodernist Critique of Red Riding Hood.\" *Journal of Gender and\nSocial Issues*, vol. 21, no. 2, 2022.\n\nCarr, Nicholas. *The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our\nBrains*.

The idea of the implied reader (in the form “postulated reader”) was first expressed in 1961 by Wayne C. Booth (137), who defined it as an image of the reader that the author creates when writing a work of fiction. The term rose to prominence when it was expanded on by Wolfgang Iser (34), who posits that the implied reader embodies all the tendencies to best experience a literary work. He emphasises that the implied reader is a construct that can be formed based on the text alone and is thus separate from the real reader (Iser 34). The term can be used to describe the knowledge levels and competences required to understand and form interpretations of a work. This can be evident in a work like Vladimir Nabokov’s _Pale Fire_ that requires attentive reading and background knowledge on literature (Phelan & Rabinowitz, 141). The concept of implied reader is often used within the context of the communicative model of reading, which describes the chain of communication between the sender and receiver of a work of literature (consisting of the real author, implied author, narrator, narratee, implied reader, and the real reader) (Chatman 151; Phelan 2–3). Similar concepts that differentiate the reader as a textual construct from the actual, flesh-and-blood reader include, among others, Umberto Eco’s (206–207) _model reader_, Peter J. Rabinowitz’s (21) _authorial audience_, and Wolf Schmid’s (53–54) _abstract reader_.\n\nDigital media has brought new elements to the interaction between the reader and the text, and research on reading experiences of \\[ergodic literature\\] and the role of the player in the context of video games has broadened the concept of the implied reader. In 1997, Espen Aarseth (_Cybertext_ 127) introduced the term “implied user” and later expanded on it in the form of “implied player” (“Fought”). In his definition, implied player is “a role made for the player by the game, a set of expectations that the player must fulfil for the game to ‘exercise its effect’”. Aarseth further argues that implied player is more material than the implied reader, since the game cannot progress without the player’s input (“Fought” 184). Building on Aarseth’s definition, Gerald Farca (195–197) specifies that the implied player is a framework that describes what kind of roles the game offers for the player to perform, such as trying to win the game, experiencing the narrative, or exploring the game world. The concept of implied reader has also been reformulated to fit the context of interface design and \\[platform studies\\] with the conceptualisation of “implied user”, characterising what kind of user the designer of an artefact had in mind when making it (Armaselu).\n\nThe concept of implied reader, along with its counterpart, \\[implied author\\], has been both influential and heavily debated since its inception. The term has been criticised as superfluous; for instance, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan (89–92) and Marie-Laure Ryan (36) have argued that the concept is not necessary for discussing the communicative chain between the author and the reader. Theorists using the concept have also been criticised for providing little indication on how it should be used methodologically (Kindt 58) and for basing their assumptions on unverifiable speculation (Bortolussi & Dixon 7; Alber). Some have even suggested that, instead of using the concept of the implied reader, the study of the reading process and interpretation should turn solely to empirical research of real readers (Alber 37–38; Bortolussi & Dixon 13). A similar tension exists in game studies as well, between researchers who want to approach the player as a construct that can be inferred from the game and researchers who want to focus on the actual, historical players (_I Fought The Law_ 183).\n\nDespite its criticisms, the concept of implied reader continues to be popular in research on literature and digital media. It can be regarded as a useful tool for discussing texts as products of intentional acts of communication without appealing directly to the real author’s wishes on how their audience should react to their work. For instance, the concept can be used to point out the differences between a hypertext reader and a reader of a conventional book (Oikonomidou), or to show how computer-generated works can have two implied readers in the sense that their reading experience can be altered depending on whether the reader reads the source code of the work or not (Hongisto).\n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Referenced\n\nAarseth, Espen J. _Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature_.

Interactive Fiction uses text as the primary mode of reader engagement, and, while some now use multi-media effects, language is the primary vehicle for both narrative and ludic elements, such as puzzles. Works are often non-linear, and experiences of an interactive fiction vary from reader to reader. Authors, readers, and scholars mostly refer to Interactive Fiction by the initialism IF (pronounced /_aɪ - ef_/).\n\nThe first IF was _Adventure_ by Will Crowther, which was written in Fortran in 1975 and distributed on ARPANET (Montfort, _Twisty Little Passages_ 91). It was updated and expanded into _Colossal Cave Adventure_ by Don Woods the following year. Players explored magical caves by typing in two-word commands, such as ‘GO EAST’ or ‘TAKE LAMP’, and the system responded by describing the new or updated environment. _Adventure_ inspired a team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop _Zork_ (1977)_,_ which is considered the first commercially successful video game. Interactive Fiction companies, such as Infocom, sprang up to commercialize the form but eventually faded in popularity as improvements in graphics and memory enabled more multimedia games.\n\nHistorically, Interactive Fiction was synonymous with ‘text adventure games’, but now the form refers to a broader group of text-based narrative games. Earlier definitions of Interactive Fiction were rooted specifically in the mechanics of interaction; the use of a text parser and command-line interface were what made something IF (Douglass 129; Short). Nick Montfort distinguishes IF from other parser-based programs as one where player input is analyzed and to some extent understood; the work does not reproduce the same sequence of texts or a random sequence regardless of player input (Montfort, _Twisty Little Passages_ viii; Montfort, ‘Toward a Theory’ 34). Even as late as the early 2010s, graphical and choice-based games were broadly excluded from being understood as IF (Plotkin 66). However, current definitions include both parser-based and choice-based IFs like _Depression Quest_ (2013) (The Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation). Choice-based IF can either refer to hypertext narratives or multiple-choice narratives and may include fewer puzzles or map-based logics as parser-based IFs.\n\nCommunity is central to IF, and it has cohered around both parser and choice-based projects. \\[Authoring software\\] and development systems like _Inform_ by Graham Nelson and \\[Twine\\] by Chris Klimas are free to use and offer robust (Anglophone) documentation and community support for new writers. Historically, the community used the newsgroup _rec.arts.int-fiction_ to communicate, but now there is the _intfiction.org_ forum, which offers hints, tips, conversation, and advice for readers and writers alike in English, Spanish, Italian, and French (The Interactive Fiction Community Forum). New work is often shared via regular competitions or ‘Jams,’ which are predominantly run by popular vote. The biggest competition is the Interactive Fiction Competition, which has been running annually since 1995.\n\nMany popular IF tools and their documentation are developed in English, but non-Anglophone IF communities thrive as well. There are distinct community fora and annual competitions, such as _Rayuela de Arena_ (Spanish), _ЗОК_ (Russian), _Grand Prix_ (German), and _Concours Annuel de Fiction Interactive Francophone_ (French). Some Sinophone IF is shared on traditional databases like IFDB; however, Sinophone electronic literature tends to be more forum-based and is also underrepresented in these databases (Guo).\n\nIF is a relatively accessible form of electronic literature, since it is regularly accompanied by walkthroughs and can often be smoothly transferred to an audio experience via screen readers for the blind and partially sighted. While there is a burgeoning trend towards commercialization in IF for well-known writers, via funding platforms like Kickstarter or Patreon, or where completed projects are available for purchase on Steam, the majority of new works are available to play for free.\n\nIn terms of thematic focus, Interactive Fiction often explores questions of choice, freedom, and agency. According to Hartmut Koenitz, recent Twine projects in particular have focused very thoroughly on issues such as ‘cultural desolation, personal identity, alienation’, perhaps because the writing process is more accessible than parser-based systems (Koenitz xii). Some smaller competitions will suggest specific creative constraints, such as projects that are based on a song or games that take place at a zoo (Chen et al.; _The Ryan Veeder Exposition for Good Interactive Fiction_). However, there are no topic limitations or restrictions inherent to the form.\n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Cited\n\nChen, Autumn, et al. ‘ShuffleComp 2023’. _Itch.Io_, 2 Dec. 2023, https://itch.io/jam/shufflecomp-2023.\n\nDouglass, Jeremy. _Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin’s Shade › Electronic Book Review_. 31 Jan. 2012, https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/enlightening-interactive-fiction-andrew-plotkins-shade/.\n\nGuo, Jinghua. ‘Electronic Literature in China’. _CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture_, vol. 16, no. 5, 2014.\n\nKoenitz, Hartmut, editor. _Interactive Digital Narrative: History, Theory and Practice_.

The term remix exists in relation to many similar terms, such as mashup, bricolage, and sampling (Gunkel 2016, 3), but remix emerged as the de facto term that encompasses the spectrum of transformative and derivative works, a synecdoche for a better term that does not exist. Remix is a contested term with many different meanings; remix can be everything from the specific practice of creating art using existing material to the “dominant aesthetics of the era of globalization” (Manovich 2013, 267) and a cultural “binder” that infects every aspect of culture (Navas 2012, 4). Remix does have one boundary, which is that works of remix should be recognizable as reinterpretation of an original (Navas 2012, 65); without this identifiable link, they cease to be a remix.\n\nLawrence Lessig popularized the term in his eponymous book from 2008, arguing that creativity in the digital age had evolved more rapidly than copyright laws have been able to adapt. The 20\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> century had seen the production of culture becoming increasingly professionalized, which limited the role of consumers. Analogue media could be remixed but has often required expensive tools and specialized knowledge, which set a steep barrier to entry. This has changed with the introduction and popularization of digital media that allows users to gather and repurpose material with ease. The use of digital media had thus been able to exceed the earlier analogue limitations and extend the expressive and performative range of literary artistry (Lessig 2008, 37).\n\nAlthough remixes are tied to the digital, there are analogue antecedents. Remix has always existed in forms, such as oral storytelling or the production and reproduction of music, and the name remix is derived from the practice of remixing music. Music remixes can be traced back to Jamaican dub in the 1960s and later, when Jamaican immigrants created Hip-Hop in New York City in the 1970s (Navas 2012, 65). Dub and Hip-Hop transformed the production and post-production of music into a performance in and of itself, turning DJs and producers into artists in their own right, as exemplified by Lev Manovich, who describes DJs as the defining author of the digital culture (Manovich 2001, 129).\n\nRemix is significant because it reframes originality. Gunkel argues that remix causes “short circuits in the material of Western thought” (2015, 171) by showing the creative potential of “derivative” works that appropriate, recombine, or resituate the work of others. Western culture favors the original over the derivative and places great emphasis on the auteurs who produce canonical works. Gunkel traces the privileged position of the original all the way back to Plato (2015, 35), who reproduced a dialogue between Socrates and Phaedrus, arguing that a transcript of a speech is nothing more than a cheap imitation of the original performance, and the idea had been further expanded by Plato in later works such as with the _Theory of Forms_ and the allegory of the cave (2015, 47). The power of remix inheres in showing that copies can be original in their own right, that they are not just doomed to be lesser. Originality in the digital age is not about producing something that has not been done before but finding new and creative uses for that which already exists.\n\nRemix emerged in the late 1990s and defined the 2000s, and while remix was “ubiquitous” coming into the 2020s (Waysdorf 2021), its hegemony is now challenged. With the emergence of generative AI, remix is more relevant than ever while at the same time at risk of being left behind by a stronger cultural force. Just as remix once defined cultural production, generative AI can once again allow for faster and easier creation of content by remixing the existing material it was trained on—often mass harvested without permission and without any traceable references to the original.\n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Cited\n\nGunkel, David J. _Of Remixology: Ethics and Aesthetics after Remix_.

Rooted in the Greek terms _techno_ (denoting art or craftsmanship) and _eikon_ (meaning image or likeness), technoeikon names the dynamic convergence of technological forms and visual expression within the digital text. Far from functioning as peripheral decoration, technoeikons—comprising animated text, graphic movement, layered soundscapes, and audiovisual sequences—constitute the very fabric of the narrative experience. They are woven into the structural and semantic core of digital works, shaping not only their aesthetic texture but also the ways in which readers interact with and interpret them.\n\nWhile paratext, as theorized by Genette (1997), traditionally serves as a peripheral threshold to the main text, the technoeikon operates as an essential structural core. It is not a supplementary embellishment but an indispensable component of the digital work, actively shaping its \"semiotic fabric\" (Shanmugapriya and Menon 647). Through the integration of kinetic visuals, sound, and interactivity, the technoeikon demands the reader’s active engagement, making participation a vital aspect of the meaning-making process. Thus, technoeikon offers a powerful framework for rethinking the ontology of the literary work in the digital age—one where language, image, sound, and code are no longer separate modes but interdependent forces in the production of narrative meaning.As demonstrated in Priti Pandurangan’s _Meghadutam_, the technoeikon manifests vividly through the dynamic interplay of visual, auditory, and performative elements. Text appears and dissolves fluidly across the screen, morphing into symbolic shapes such as flowers, nautilus shells, waves, and ultimately, tears—each transformation corresponding to shifts in the narrative’s emotional arc. This kinetic typography not only illustrates the storyline but also embodies the evolving inner states of the narrator.\n\nComplementing these visual motifs are carefully orchestrated soundscapes: the hissing of the wind, the rhythmic crash of waves, and the reverberation of thumping drums, all of which intensify the atmosphere and heighten narrative tension. Moreover, the inclusion of a voice artist’s spoken dialogue further deepens the emotional resonance, offering an aural dimension to the narrator’s experience.\n\nTogether, these elements—the animated text, ambient sounds, and vocal performance—constitute the technoeikon, crafting a rich, immersive environment. They do not merely accompany the text but are integral to its unfolding, enabling readers to viscerally inhabit the narrator’s emotional journey. Through this fusion of sensory and semiotic layers, the digital _Meghadutam_ exemplifies how technoeikon transforms reading into a profoundly embodied and affective experience.\n\n## Works Referenced\n\nGenette, Gérard. _Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation._ Edited by Richard Macksey, translated by Jane E.

In this regard, an example could be the _Lord of the Rings_ saga, whose primary passage from the literary medium to the cinematic one represents an effective result, reached through specific differences and meaningful additions to the original narrative object.\n\nThe first definition of the concept is attributed to Henry Jenkins (2006), who discusses the term in relation to the reproduction of the same narrative phenomenon across different media. Specifically, the author frames the term as a peculiar consequence of _Convergence Culture_, understood as a “cultural shift, as consumers are encouraged to seek out new information and make connections among dispersed media content” (3). It is this cultural shift ‒ namely, the rise of Convergence Culture ‒ that gives rise to transmediality. This shift has particular characteristics, the most important being the high degree of participatory involvement from the audience. In fact, Convergence should not be understood as a passive and inevitable collapse of various media into a single device, but rather as the possibility for the user to search for a narratively significant phenomenon across different media (3). Transmediality, then, becomes the primary condition for the narrative phenomenon in the increasingly participatory era of Convergence.\n\nThis convergent turn and the resulting transmedial condition, as thus defined, prove to be fertile on a theoretical level. The first result is the definition of “transmedia storytelling” (21), understood as the creation of a narrative system extended across different media that encourages the user to move ‒ figuratively ‒ across the platforms and peculiar manifestations of the narrative object itself. Nevertheless, this definition remains highly debated, as some scholars emphasize the participatory dimension of the user in the very creation of the transmedial narrative universe and in the production of its meaning, with a pronounced semiotic approach (Scolari 2009). Alternatively, the referents of this category may change, encompassing very different narrative phenomena, ranging from literary antecedents to the ecosystem of TV series (Ryan 2013).\n\nFurthermore, the definition of transmediality in recent decades has required a concrete distinction from the neighbouring concept of _intermediality_ (Schröter 2012), which, by comparison, remains focused on the superficial dimension of _in-betweenness_ among different media, without addressing the specific and contrasting transformations that the narrative object undergoes in its transition between media (Rajewsky 2018).\n\nUltimately, transmediality is employed as a hermeneutic concept centered on two coordinates: the contact between different media ‒ more and more frequent in the hyper-contemporary age ‒ and the high degree of participation that the user maintains within this universe of hybridizations and _across-media_ contacts. Precisely for this reason, a concept so inclined toward hybridization and participation proves useful in addressing the concerns of fields of study that may differ widely: from media theory to aesthetics, including literary criticism and the social manifestations of literature (Murray 2018; Policastro 2021).\n\n## Works Referenced\n\nJenkins, Henry. _Convergent Culture: Where Old and New Media collide._ New York University Press, 2006.\n\nMurray, Simone. _The Digital Literary Sphere.
