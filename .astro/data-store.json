The term derives from the Latin word _appropriare,_ which means “to make one’s own”, from the Latin root _proprius,_ meaning “own,” the root of the word “property” (Rogers 475). The idea of appropriation has been common in art since the 1970s (Pichlmair 1). In the second half of the 20th century, appropriation art aimed to decontextualize the symbols of consumerism, such as brands, advertisements, and logos. Today, this practice is well-established in mass-production of cultural products and digital content, including films, electronic literature (e-lit), video games, etc.\n\n_Appropriation_ intersects with the term _adaptation_. Both terms are dependent on the established canons, whether in the realm of traditional literature or in the emerging field of digital narratives and are closely interrelated. However, adaptation usually signals a relationship with an informing source text either through its title or through more embedded references. Appropriation often transforms the original work into a different cultural product by adding elements or offering critique, which may result in a new genre (Sanders 35) or implicit collaboration (Skains 1). Appropriation is based on re-interpretation and implies comparative approaches and juxtaposing the initial work against a new creation. Such creations involve complex, layered, and hidden relationships with their source material compared to the more direct approach of a film adaptation of a well-known text.\n\nHistorically, appropriation is deeply rooted in postmodernism, where techniques such as pastiche, intertextuality, bricolage, and sampling have come to define aesthetic and textual strategies. Postmodern artists and writers had blurred the lines between high and low culture, originality and imitation, making appropriation a hallmark of postmodern expression and a method for questioning authenticity, authorship, and the stability of meaning.\n\nAmong problematic aspects of appropriation are the modern legal notions of copyright (homage, plagiarism), ethical questions, and cultural heritage preservation. The concept of “cultural appropriation”, intertwined with cultural politics, is often associated with the commodification of marginalized and/or colonized cultures (Rogers 474). It reconsiders the accessibility of art forms across different cultures, the issues of inclusion, and the questions of cross-cultural justice. Sinnreich et al. (2009) showed that the attitudes of audience toward appropriation depend upon the perception of commercialism and originality in the piece; if the work was appropriated for profit, or if the appropriated work was seen as copying rather than contributing something original, it was more likely to be seen as unethical.\n\nWith the rise of AI-generated content, remix culture on platforms like TikTok and YouTube, and the mass circulation of memes, the debates surrounding the ethics of appropriation, authorship, and originality have become even more complex. For example, Nicholas Carr argues that the digital environment’s emphasis on fragmentation and rapid consumption undermines the very depth of engagement with cultural works. He claims that in a digital age where users are encouraged to quickly consume and repurpose information, the practice of appropriation becomes shallow and loses its critical potential. Carr writes that the digital age promotes “cursory reading, hurried and distracted thinking, and superficial learning” (Carr 116), turning the act of appropriation into a surface-level interaction rather than a meaningful transformation. In contrast, Lev Manovich offers a more optimistic perspective. He highlights sampling, remixing, and database logic as fundamental features of new media, suggesting that digital artworks often emerge as compilations or recombinations of pre-existing cultural materials rather than entirely original creations. Manovich contends that creativity lies not in inventing entirely new elements, but in assembling existing objects in a new selection and sequence that makes the work original (Manovich 130). In a similar fashion, Jonathan Lethem defends appropriation, claiming that appropriation, imitation, quoting, referencing, and subtle collaboration are essential parts of creativity and appear in all forms and genres of cultural work (Lethem 61). He argues that appropriation, whether in traditional or digital forms, is a flow of shared ideas rather than a simple case of stealing.\n\nLawrence Lessig’s work on remix culture provides a key legal and ethical framework for understanding appropriation in the digital age. He argues that remixing—creatively reusing cultural content—is vital to modern cultural production and that digital technologies will reshape the way people access content (Lessig 72). Lessig critiques traditional copyright laws for conflicting with non-commercial creative practices and advocates for a more flexible legal approach that supports _free culture_.\n\nAs for the existing examples of appropriation works in the field of e-lit, Donna Leishman’s Red Riding Hood (2001) illustrates a postmodern shift toward minimalism and layered meanings through its reimagining of the classic fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood. While the basic plot elements remain similar (Red Riding Hood’s mother sends her to her grandmother with a basket, and she travels through the forest, meeting a boy, instead of a wolf), Leishman then updates the story to reflect contemporary issues (Almas 83). The modern appropriation questions traditional distinctions between good and evil, innocence and experience, highlighting a more nuanced and ambiguous portrayal of the characters.\n\nIn the medium of video games, a new media piece _PainStation (2001)_ exemplifies appropriation of art in two ways: it incorporates an intuitive reference to the Sony PlayStation (home video game console released in 1994) while also appropriating _Pong_ (table tennis–themed twitch arcade, 1972), one of the earliest video games. _PainStation_ is an interactive game where two players compete against each other, where losing points results in physical discomfort, such as heat, electric shocks, or whips, as controlled by the game’s feedback system, adding a unique and intense sensory dimension to gameplay_._ The game merges cultural concepts such as brands, merit, endurance, and competition and unites these elements into a single interactive art piece (Pichlmair 3).","src/content/terms/appropriation.md","79c6037c1189847b",{"html":104,"metadata":105},"\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Appropriation\u003C/em> involves reusing existing content — text, images, audio, or videos — and turning it into a different creation, such as \u003Ca href=\"/terms/meme/\">memes\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"/terms/remix/\">remixes\u003C/a>, and mashups.

They seek to provide alternative perspectives and new hypotheses to interpret reality and can be considered myths that can mobilize people to form new groups in an attempt to create the social orders they want (Maly). As narratives, they consist of plots—sequences of events that hinge on at least one temporal juncture, a shift in time that links events—and blend fictive with non-fictive discourses (Mason, 4).\n\nConspiracy theories are as old as civilization itself. The most well-known conspiracy theories include the ones prompted by events like the shooting of John F. Kennedy in 1962 and the attacks on the Twin Towers and Pentagon in Manhattan on September 11, 2001. The internet, and especially Web 2.0, has made them particularly pervasive as meaning-making practices shaped by digital infrastructures and networked participation. This form of narrative relies on participatory and fragmented discourse and intertextual connections. Increasingly, hybrid narratives mix fictional and non-fictional elements, making it difficult to determine genre and intent. Algorithmic media amplify online discourse, which is decontextualized, often anonymous, and expressed through multiple modalities such as text, image, audio, and video, making authenticity harder to assess. Some conspiracy theories originate as acts of trolling but gain traction online, while others are created with genuine conviction (Mason).\n\nThe rise of AI and deepfakes further complicates the ability to discern whether a speaker is deliberately lying, being sincere, ironic, trolling, or simply confused. AI chatbots based on large language models (LLMs) can interact with conspiracy theories in complex ways: when prompted, they may unreflectively present conspiratorial claims as factual, especially if the model has encountered these narratives widely online. Efforts, both legal and technical, are underway to mitigate this risk. These include content moderation guidelines, disclaimers, and algorithmic interventions designed to prevent AI from amplifying demonstrably false claims (Romanishyn et al.).\n\nThese challenges are not hypothetical. The notorious “Pizzagate” conspiracy gained widespread attention in 2016 due to its real-world consequences. Originating on 4chan, it suggested that a child trafficking ring, run by members of the Democratic Party, was operating out of a Washington D.C. pizza parlor. A month later, a man entered the restaurant armed with an AR-15 assault rifle, believing he was there to rescue child victims. He fired three shots before being arrested and later justified his actions by stating he was conducting his own investigation into the conspiracy (see Tuters et al.).\n\nBeyond extreme cases like Pizzagate, conspiracy narratives thrive in broader cultural contexts where fan communities and subcultures perceive the world as layered with hidden meanings. Conspiracy narratives also pervade fandom. The #FreeBritney movement scrutinized Britney Spears’ conservatorship. ‘Swifties’ are devoted to decoding the many “easter eggs” their idol Taylor Swift puts in her videos, lyrics, and appearances. Amber Heard’s defamation trial (2022), P Diddy’s 2024 arrest, and Kate Middleton’s public absence (2024) also fueled wild speculations, whereas K-pop group BTS and Beyoncé have been linked to the Illuminati or ‘New World Order’. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argued that “protocols of unveiling have become the common currency of cultural and historical studies” (Sedgwick, 143). Today, this attitude defines media culture at large. This search for hidden meanings is fundamentally hermeneutic, involving interpretation and the uncovering of underlying significance (Van de Ven and Chateau).\n\nJust as audiences decode hidden meanings in real-world conspiracies and celebrity culture, fictional narratives invite similar interpretative labor. Films, TV series, games, and works of electronic literature employ conspiratorial storytelling. often mirroring classical detective fiction in which protagonists investigate mysteries that expand as new information emerges (Fenster 2008). Post-network series such as \\*The X-Files\\*, \\*Lost\\*, and \\*Stranger Things\\* engage audiences in a mode of spectatorship that mirrors conspiracy theorizing, encouraging close attention to formal aspects, plot twists, and diegetic events. As Mittell (35) notes, complex TV series provide “cognitive workouts”, honing problem-solving and observational skills, while Brinker (4) emphasizes the significant time and effort these interpretative communities demand, setting a high threshold for media literacy and information-processing.\n\nTogether, these dynamics illustrate how conspiracy narratives, from real-world to fictional, shape how audiences interpret, evaluate, and engage with information in an increasingly mediated and participatory culture.","src/content/terms/conspiracy-theory.md","d6f7ac9ce5b8d489",{"html":321,"metadata":322},"\u003Cp>Conspiracy theories are commonly understood as beliefs that a group secretly collaborates for harmful or deceitful goals, relying on selective reasoning, mistrust of authorities, and the assumption that hidden forces manipulate reality for their own gain (Bale).

Funkhouser 37), the term “digital poetry” itself did not enter critical discourse until several decades later. As poetic experimentation evolved alongside advances in digital technology, a wide array of labels emerged in an effort to define these technology-dependent poetic practices. Among them were “computer poetry” (1959, 1960, 1962), “virtual poetry” or “vpoem” (1995), “cyberpoetry” (1996), “electronic poetry” or “e-poetry” (1996), “interpoetry” (1997/1998), etc., (for a more extensive catalogue of what Jorge Luis Antonio terms “various names for digital poetry”, see Antonio). These early efforts reflect a broader attempt to distinguish poetry created for and through digital media from both pre-digital literary forms and other types of electronic writing. \n\nAlthough the definition of “digital poetry” continues to evolve, there is general agreement that this phenomenon cannot be reduced to a singular genre or form. Rather, the phrase “digital poetry” is most commonly used as an umbrella term encompassing what C.T. Funkhouser succinctly describes as “a conglomeration of forms that now constitutes a genre even though the creative activity itself – in terms of its media, methods, and expressive intent – contains heterogeneous components” (Funkhouser 1; cf. Friedrich W. Block et al. 13; Rettberg 118). Some of the intersecting practices it is seen to include are (cf. Strehovec): kinetic/animated poetry (e.g., bpNichol’s collection *First Screening: Computer Poems* 1984), code poetry (e.g., Mez Breeze’s collection *Human Readable Messages: [Mezangelle 2003–2011]* 2011), poetry generators (e.g., John Cayley’s poem “The Speaking Clock” 1995), and interactive poetry (e.g., Jim Rosenberg’s *Intergrams* 1993). Other examples include digital sound poetry (e.g., Jörg Piringer’s poem “80x25,” n.d.), ergodic/visual digital poetry (e.g., Lionel Kearns’s “Birth of God/uniVerse” 1965), and digital textscapes/installations with poetic features (e.g., Nalini Malani’s installation *In Search of Vanished Blood* 2012). As evolving as its definition, digital poetry itself is often regarded as a “process” both in diachronic terms of its ongoing engagement with changing computerised techniques (Funkhouser 1–2) and in synchronic terms of its ontological dependence as an “event” on the hardware and software needed to execute a specific digital poem (Hayles 181–182).  \n\nAs such, digital poetry has inspired two main critical approaches, often used in tandem. The first wishes to establish a broader literary lineage and to explain the characteristics of digital poetry through its continuities with earlier literary traditions: for example, the ancient rhetorical practice of ekphrasis, an exercise aimed at engaging the audience’s imagination through vivid, descriptive language (Lindhé), concrete poetry (Stefans), language poetry (Glazier), or premodernist, modernist, and postmodernist techniques in general (Funkhouser 10–18). The second, rooted in the broader field of electronic literature, foregrounds the importance of media-specific analysis and the unique affordances of digital environments in which these works are produced and experienced (Hayles 2006, Rettberg). \n\nDespite the rise of “digital poetry” as the dominant term in the field, alternative labels such as “computer poetry”, “cyberpoetry”, “e-poetry”, and the broader concept of “digital poetics” that avoids affirming “digital poetry” as a distinct category, remain in circulation and testify both to the field’s heterogeneous origins and the continuous lack of a fully settled critical lexicon (Funkhouser 22). Additionally, current critical discourse makes an important distinction between studies of digital poetry and studies of poetry in the digital age. The latter often explores both digital and digitised poetry, i.e. poetry that is neither born-digital nor fully technology-dependent and tends to circulate across digital and analog formats (Benthien, Matter et al., Stein).","src/content/terms/digital-poetry.md","67161092129a1d65",{"html":479,"metadata":480},"\u003Cp>While Theo Lutz’s 1959 stochastic experiment on a Zuse Z22 computer is often credited as the first digital poem (Lutz 1959; cf.

While affirmative fandom activities only seek to confirm and echo the world as laid out by the author, fans may also choose to transform the source material through making art, reproducing and adjusting costumes, creating fake social media channels for individual characters, or in a myriad of other ways (see Busse “Geek Hierarchies”, Zygutis, Correa-Chávez).\n\nHistorically, the beginning of fanfiction as a practice is thought to have evolved from the formation of media fandoms, which in turn were heavily influenced by and closely connected to US American science fiction fandoms in the 1960s (Coppa). Often centred on or fuelled by relationships between characters, both platonic and not (Coppa, Jenkins Textual Poachers), transformative engagement with a source may include, but is not limited to, reworkings of characters, settings, elements or the entirety of the original plot, or genre. Through its transformative approach to a source text, fanfiction by definition interacts with and reworks concepts of authorship, creative hierarchies, and authorial intent, thus reflecting and playing out conflicting aspects of authorship inherent in all sorts of creative endeavours (Busse 20).\n\nAs a result, the academic study of fanfiction has given rise to new avenues of thinking about creative writing, such as Derecho’s understanding of fanfiction as not only antihierarchical, but more specifically archontic. Leaning on “Derrida’s understanding of archives as ever expanding and never completely closed” (61), she proposes an approach to fanfiction which understands any new story as a contribution to an archive with a constant “tendency toward enlargement and accretion” (64). Unlike the concept of intertextuality, she defines archontic literature as a form free from notions of hierarchy and property rights and comparative merits, “works which generate variations that explicitly announce themselves as variations” (65).\n\nPartially by necessity, fanfiction cannot exist within a conventional capitalist system for fear of legal consequences over the ownership of creative rights. From this unique positioning result, not only elements of the landscape such as disclaimers (Busse and Hellekson), a rejection of the monetisation of fanfiction-adjacent creative efforts (Jones, Buchsbaum), and a general tendency of fanzines (where fanfiction as a fan activity began) to be sold at a loss (Jones), but also a general understanding of fanfiction to be functioning on a gift economy (Hellekson). Positioned as a female-coded opposition to a capitalist system centred around monetary value, the gift economy frames the exchange of creative fan labour in all its forms as constitutive of the social networks and larger metatext of fan communities (Hellekson). Consequently, while fannish meaning-making doubtlessly stands in connection with the individual involved in its construction (Jenkins 34), the contexts in which it is shared, received, and reacted to are inherently social, communal, and collaborative. In other words, fanfiction, while without specific value outside of a fannish system, is created, shared, gifted and exchanged as part of a networked community creatively engaging with one or multiple source(s). Since such collaborations have, in general, become easier in the digital age, this key characteristic of fanfiction as a social medium has been additionally facilitated by its transformation into a predominantly digital narrative format.\n\nIn conjunction with the predominance of female fans in _transformative_ fan spaces (centreoftheselights, Rouse and Stanfill, Hellekson), fanfiction’s non-commercial, antihierarchical, transformative nature has been argued to make the medium uniquely suitable to the exploration of topics of inclusivity and diversity, as well as to the development of democratic modes of engagement (Jenkins “Rethinking”, Derecho, Stanfill). Media fandom, and with it, the writing, receiving and exchanging of fanfiction, is thus viewed not only a female, but specifically a feminist activity (Busse 34–36; Hellekson). Values considered to be inherent to fannish activities – such as the centering of marginalised voices and themes – thus play a notable role in how both scholarship and fans themselves view transformative fandom.\n\nWith the introduction of the internet, media fandom, alongside fan fiction spaces, has moved to and across different online platforms (Coppa). One dominant factor in such platform migrations has always been a search for safety from censorship and discriminatory content moderation practices, a desideratum which the founding of the fanfiction platform _Archive of Our Own_ aimed to address (astolat, Lothian, Fiesler and Dym). The archive, conceptualised as a fan-run non-profit and situated in the broader context of the _Organization for Transformative Works_, is both manifestation and continuous (re-)creation of common fanfiction principles, such as gift giving, exchanges and paratexts, but also more abstract values like tolerance and diversity (Lothian and Stanfill). As part of this paratext, the archive allows readers to filter stories through a variety of tags. Not only may a reader thus look for or avoid specific plots, tropes or themes, authors may comment on and situate their stories within an extensive metatext (Leavenworth). On the flip side, the _Archive of Our Own_ lacks a filter for racist content, whereas erotic content featuring underage characters, rape or graphic descriptions of violence may be filtered out via the platform’s standardised warning categories. Despite the understanding of fandoms to be inherently predisposed to progressive ideologies, racism and discrimination may be found in many of its community structures (Lothian and Stanfill; for further reading see Pande).","src/content/terms/fanfiction.md","07694330792ac737",{"html":603,"metadata":604},"\u003Cp>Fanfiction writing is commonly considered an expression of transformative fandom as opposed to “affirmative” fandom (Hills).

In other words, fanfiction, while without specific value outside of a fannish system, is created, shared, gifted and exchanged as part of a networked community creatively engaging with one or multiple source(s). Since such collaborations have, in general, become easier in the digital age, this key characteristic of fanfiction as a social medium has been additionally facilitated by its transformation into a predominantly digital narrative format.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In conjunction with the predominance of female fans in \u003Cem>transformative\u003C/em> fan spaces (centreoftheselights, Rouse and Stanfill, Hellekson), fanfiction’s non-commercial, antihierarchical, transformative nature has been argued to make the medium uniquely suitable to the exploration of topics of inclusivity and diversity, as well as to the development of democratic modes of engagement (Jenkins “Rethinking”, Derecho, Stanfill). Media fandom, and with it, the writing, receiving and exchanging of fanfiction, is thus viewed not only a female, but specifically a feminist activity (Busse 34–36; Hellekson). Values considered to be inherent to fannish activities – such as the centering of marginalised voices and themes – thus play a notable role in how both scholarship and fans themselves view transformative fandom.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With the introduction of the internet, media fandom, alongside fan fiction spaces, has moved to and across different online platforms (Coppa). One dominant factor in such platform migrations has always been a search for safety from censorship and discriminatory content moderation practices, a desideratum which the founding of the fanfiction platform \u003Cem>Archive of Our Own\u003C/em> aimed to address (astolat, Lothian, Fiesler and Dym). The archive, conceptualised as a fan-run non-profit and situated in the broader context of the \u003Cem>Organization for Transformative Works\u003C/em>, is both manifestation and continuous (re-)creation of common fanfiction principles, such as gift giving, exchanges and paratexts, but also more abstract values like tolerance and diversity (Lothian and Stanfill). As part of this paratext, the archive allows readers to filter stories through a variety of tags. Not only may a reader thus look for or avoid specific plots, tropes or themes, authors may comment on and situate their stories within an extensive metatext (Leavenworth). On the flip side, the \u003Cem>Archive of Our Own\u003C/em> lacks a filter for racist content, whereas erotic content featuring underage characters, rape or graphic descriptions of violence may be filtered out via the platform’s standardised warning categories. Despite the understanding of fandoms to be inherently predisposed to progressive ideologies, racism and discrimination may be found in many of its community structures (Lothian and Stanfill; for further reading see Pande).\u003C/p>",{"headings":605,"localImagePaths":606,"remoteImagePaths":607,"frontmatter":608,"imagePaths":611},[],[],[],{"title":586,"description":587,"author":588,"pubDate":609,"seeAlso":610,"worksReferenced":597,"furtherReading":598},["Date","2025-11-04T00:00:00.000Z"],[592,594,596],[],"flash",{"id":612,"data":614,"filePath":617,"digest":618,"rendered":619},{"title":615,"description":616},"Flash","Defunct

In computer semiotics, the understanding of the computer interface refers to situations where human systems of signs and representation intersect with computational processes of signals (Nake). Commonly, interfaces are experienced as graphical user interfaces on screens, but as pointed out by software studies scholars, numerous other interfaces make a computational system function. There are interfaces between humans and computers; there are voice-based interfaces. There are also interfaces between layers of software, such as the interface between a computer’s operating system and the running software application. Additionally, interfaces exist between software and hardware—for example, the interface in a printer that detects and validates data when printing—or between one hardware component and another, such as a USB socket, a serial port, or a wireless network (Cramer and Fuller). The networked computer therefore does not have one interface but is a conglomerate of interfaces – from deep machine levels to human levels of representation. At all levels, interfaces carry with them a politics of regulation and embed cultural values (Distelmeyer; Drucker).\n\nThe sign/signal interrelation and the many levels of interfaces are important for an understanding of the metainterface. The metainterface transcends the traditional boundaries of the interface, e.g., the graphical user interface. Rather than simply connecting humans with computers, the metainterface emphasizes that the world of computing cannot be neatly divided into separate user interfaces. As a concept, it tries to capture how a global network of interfaces acts and acts upon us, constantly and everywhere (Christian Ulrik Andersen and Søren Pold _The Metainterface_). In this way, the metainterface refers to how cloud computing, platforms, and generative AI work with profiling, data capture, and data processing, and how this is typically presented to the user as an individualized interface to massified data. This could be reels or news feed in social media, suggested products in a search engine, suggestions in a media streaming platform, people to connect with in social or professional networking, or dashboard visualizations of data and insights in business intelligence software (Tkacz).\n\nThe metainterface is experienced as being everywhere and nowhere, making it difficult to pin down; along with it comes a loss of narrative transparency. To ordinary users of monopolistic platforms closed to public inspection, transparency has long been lost. As we are gradually moving away from a conventional hypertextual writing space (Nelson) towards dynamic texts of platforms, multi-authored texts of social media, and generated texts of large language models, the writing space becomes increasingly abstract, and it becomes increasingly difficult to understand how the text is generated and from what. Whereas inspecting the source code of a platform interface, for example, once revealed what was presented to the user, it now reveals very little (Christian Ulrik Andersen and Søren Bro Pold; Moll). Likewise, the interfaces of generative AI involve so-called connectionist AI, meaning that the generation of text is based on models that are trained using machine learning, rather than through programming of text. It is simply no longer possible, even for a programmer, to read the code or “infer the underlying rules by running the program” (Bajohr 220).\n\nContemporary digital narratives both reflect the loss of narrative transparency and use the metainterface as a channel for literary experimentation–exploring, for example, how to write collaboratively with AI, examine its style, analyze its gendered, racist and other biases, or understand the kind of narratives and texts it generates (Christian Ulrik Andersen and Søren Pold \"The User as a Character\"; Bajohr \"On Artificial and Post-Artificial Texts\"; Erslev; Rettberg; Scourti; Walker Rettberg). Operating within the restrictions of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or the terms of service, for instance, they often also reflect the business model of the metainterface that seems to capitalize not just on what is written in these spaces, but on language itself (Cayley; Grosser; Ritasdatter), and how the metainterface functions as a new cultural industry (Christian Ulrik Andersen and Søren Pold _The Metainterface_).\n\nDigital narratives also make way for whole new understandings of the massive impacts on our climate and environment that the infrastructures of the metainterface cause – of media as material constructs (Valk). The boundless use of resources is imperative: from the exploitation of labor in training algorithms, to the mining of costly minerals for smartphones, to the energy used by ‘the cloud’ and edge devices on the network. One might even argue that the environment itself becomes a medium, where the metainterface’s use of resources manifests as changes in the landscape or in the biosphere – potentially as a narrative or art object in and of itself (Gil-Fournier and Parikka). As a ‘meta’ construction and abstraction, the metainterface tends to hide these material conditions.","src/content/terms/metainterface.md","8b4652ba2940ddb1",{"html":902,"metadata":903},"\u003Cp>There are many different definitions of interface; the notion of metainterface rests on an understanding of the interface developed from computer semiotics and software studies.

new works by repurposing existing material. The term remix exists in relation to many similar terms, such as mashup, bricolage, and sampling (Gunkel 2016, 3), but remix emerged as the de facto term that encompasses the spectrum of transformative and derivative works, a synecdoche for a better term that does not exist. Remix is a contested term with many different meanings; remix can be everything from the specific practice of creating art using existing material to the “dominant aesthetics of the era of globalization” (Manovich 2013, 267) and a cultural “binder” that infects every aspect of culture (Navas 2012, 4). Remix does have one boundary, which is that works of remix should be recognizable as reinterpretation of an original (Navas 2012, 65); without this identifiable link, they cease to be a remix.\n\nLawrence Lessig popularized the term in his eponymous book from 2008, arguing that creativity in the digital age had evolved more rapidly than copyright laws have been able to adapt. The 20\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> century had seen the production of culture becoming increasingly professionalized, which limited the role of consumers. Analogue media could be remixed but has often required expensive tools and specialized knowledge, which set a steep barrier to entry. This has changed with the introduction and popularization of digital media that allows users to gather and repurpose material with ease. The use of digital media had thus been able to exceed the earlier analogue limitations and extend the expressive and performative range of literary artistry (Lessig 2008, 37).\n\nAlthough remixes are tied to the digital, there are analogue antecedents. Remix has always existed in forms, such as oral storytelling or the production and reproduction of music, and the name remix is derived from the practice of remixing music. Music remixes can be traced back to Jamaican dub in the 1960s and later, when Jamaican immigrants created Hip-Hop in New York City in the 1970s (Navas 2012, 65). Dub and Hip-Hop transformed the production and post-production of music into a performance in and of itself, turning DJs and producers into artists in their own right, as exemplified by Lev Manovich, who describes DJs as the defining author of the digital culture (Manovich 2001, 129).\n\nRemix is significant because it reframes originality. Gunkel argues that remix causes “short circuits in the material of Western thought” (2015, 171) by showing the creative potential of “derivative” works that appropriate, recombine, or resituate the work of others. Western culture favors the original over the derivative and places great emphasis on the auteurs who produce canonical works. Gunkel traces the privileged position of the original all the way back to Plato (2015, 35), who reproduced a dialogue between Socrates and Phaedrus, arguing that a transcript of a speech is nothing more than a cheap imitation of the original performance, and the idea had been further expanded by Plato in later works such as with the _Theory of Forms_ and the allegory of the cave (2015, 47). The power of remix inheres in showing that copies can be original in their own right, that they are not just doomed to be lesser. Originality in the digital age is not about producing something that has not been done before but finding new and creative uses for that which already exists.\n\nRemix emerged in the late 1990s and defined the 2000s, and while remix was “ubiquitous” coming into the 2020s (Waysdorf 2021), its hegemony is now challenged. With the emergence of generative AI, remix is more relevant than ever while at the same time at risk of being left behind by a stronger cultural force. Just as remix once defined cultural production, generative AI can once again allow for faster and easier creation of content by remixing the existing material it was trained on—often mass harvested without permission and without any traceable references to the original.\n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Cited\n\nGunkel, David J. _Of Remixology: Ethics and Aesthetics after Remix_.

This development marked a pivotal moment in the history of electronic literature. Joyce and Bolter initially gave out copies to colleagues through riverrun ltd in 1987, before Storyspace received its first commercial release through Eastgate Systems in 1990 (Bernstein, \"Storyspace 1\" 172-181). Unlike many early hypertext systems that have been lost to technological obsolescence, Storyspace has maintained continuous development under Mark Bernstein's leadership since the 1990s. Bernstein developed Storyspace for Windows (1992) and created Storyspace 2 (2003) as a complete reimplementation. The software evolved further with Storyspace 3 (2015), built on the Hereford back-end—a database engine developed for Tinderbox, Eastgate's personal information management and note-taking software—and Storyspace 3.5, which integrated traditional guard fields with an enhanced action language while maintaining backward compatibility—a remarkable achievement in software longevity that challenges assumptions about digital preservation.\n\nStoryspace introduced architectonic writing—a method of spatial organization, where narrative elements are arranged and connected in three-dimensional conceptual space rather than linear sequence (Bolter, _Writing Space_).

Smith developed Storyspace in the late 1980s (Bolter and Joyce 41-50). This development marked a pivotal moment in the history of electronic literature. Joyce and Bolter initially gave out copies to colleagues through riverrun ltd in 1987, before Storyspace received its first commercial release through Eastgate Systems in 1990 (Bernstein, “Storyspace 1” 172-181). Unlike many early hypertext systems that have been lost to technological obsolescence, Storyspace has maintained continuous development under Mark Bernstein’s leadership since the 1990s. Bernstein developed Storyspace for Windows (1992) and created Storyspace 2 (2003) as a complete reimplementation. The software evolved further with Storyspace 3 (2015), built on the Hereford back-end—a database engine developed for Tinderbox, Eastgate’s personal information management and note-taking software—and Storyspace 3.5, which integrated traditional guard fields with an enhanced action language while maintaining backward compatibility—a remarkable achievement in software longevity that challenges assumptions about digital preservation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Storyspace introduced architectonic writing—a method of spatial organization, where narrative elements are arranged and connected in three-dimensional conceptual space rather than linear sequence (Bolter, \u003Cem>Writing Space\u003C/em>).

De Gruyter, 2014, pp. 301–309.","The term implied reader refers to an ideal recipient of a work whose disposition can be inferred from the text. The idea of the implied reader (in the form “postulated reader”) was first expressed in 1961 by Wayne C. Booth (137), who defined it as an image of the reader that the author creates when writing a work of fiction. The term rose to prominence when it was expanded on by Wolfgang Iser (34), who posits that the implied reader embodies all the tendencies to best experience a literary work. He emphasises that the implied reader is a construct that can be formed based on the text alone and is thus separate from the real reader (Iser 34). The term can be used to describe the knowledge levels and competences required to understand and form interpretations of a work. This can be evident in a work like Vladimir Nabokov’s _Pale Fire_ that requires attentive reading and background knowledge on literature (Phelan & Rabinowitz, 141). The concept of implied reader is often used within the context of the communicative model of reading, which describes the chain of communication between the sender and receiver of a work of literature (consisting of the real author, implied author, narrator, narratee, implied reader, and the real reader) (Chatman 151; Phelan 2–3). Similar concepts that differentiate the reader as a textual construct from the actual, flesh-and-blood reader include, among others, Umberto Eco’s (206–207) _model reader_, Peter J. Rabinowitz’s (21) _authorial audience_, and Wolf Schmid’s (53–54) _abstract reader_.\n\nDigital media has brought new elements to the interaction between the reader and the text, and research on reading experiences of \\[ergodic literature\\] and the role of the player in the context of video games has broadened the concept of the implied reader. In 1997, Espen Aarseth (_Cybertext_ 127) introduced the term “implied user” and later expanded on it in the form of “implied player” (“Fought”). In his definition, implied player is “a role made for the player by the game, a set of expectations that the player must fulfil for the game to ‘exercise its effect’”. Aarseth further argues that implied player is more material than the implied reader, since the game cannot progress without the player’s input (“Fought” 184). Building on Aarseth’s definition, Gerald Farca (195–197) specifies that the implied player is a framework that describes what kind of roles the game offers for the player to perform, such as trying to win the game, experiencing the narrative, or exploring the game world. The concept of implied reader has also been reformulated to fit the context of interface design and \\[platform studies\\] with the conceptualisation of “implied user”, characterising what kind of user the designer of an artefact had in mind when making it (Armaselu).\n\nThe concept of implied reader, along with its counterpart, \\[implied author\\], has been both influential and heavily debated since its inception. The term has been criticised as superfluous; for instance, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan (89–92) and Marie-Laure Ryan (36) have argued that the concept is not necessary for discussing the communicative chain between the author and the reader. Theorists using the concept have also been criticised for providing little indication on how it should be used methodologically (Kindt 58) and for basing their assumptions on unverifiable speculation (Bortolussi & Dixon 7; Alber). Some have even suggested that, instead of using the concept of the implied reader, the study of the reading process and interpretation should turn solely to empirical research of real readers (Alber 37–38; Bortolussi & Dixon 13). A similar tension exists in game studies as well, between researchers who want to approach the player as a construct that can be inferred from the game and researchers who want to focus on the actual, historical players (_I Fought The Law_ 183).\n\nDespite its criticisms, the concept of implied reader continues to be popular in research on literature and digital media. It can be regarded as a useful tool for discussing texts as products of intentional acts of communication without appealing directly to the real author’s wishes on how their audience should react to their work. For instance, the concept can be used to point out the differences between a hypertext reader and a reader of a conventional book (Oikonomidou), or to show how computer-generated works can have two implied readers in the sense that their reading experience can be altered depending on whether the reader reads the source code of the work or not (Hongisto).","src/content/terms/implied-reader.md","a6dfccf5dfdf20fd",{"html":1404,"metadata":1405},"\u003Cp>The term implied reader refers to an ideal recipient of a work whose disposition can be inferred from the text. The idea of the implied reader (in the form “postulated reader”) was first expressed in 1961 by Wayne C. Booth (137), who defined it as an image of the reader that the author creates when writing a work of fiction. The term rose to prominence when it was expanded on by Wolfgang Iser (34), who posits that the implied reader embodies all the tendencies to best experience a literary work. He emphasises that the implied reader is a construct that can be formed based on the text alone and is thus separate from the real reader (Iser 34). The term can be used to describe the knowledge levels and competences required to understand and form interpretations of a work. This can be evident in a work like Vladimir Nabokov’s \u003Cem>Pale Fire\u003C/em> that requires attentive reading and background knowledge on literature (Phelan &#x26; Rabinowitz, 141). The concept of implied reader is often used within the context of the communicative model of reading, which describes the chain of communication between the sender and receiver of a work of literature (consisting of the real author, implied author, narrator, narratee, implied reader, and the real reader) (Chatman 151; Phelan 2–3). Similar concepts that differentiate the reader as a textual construct from the actual, flesh-and-blood reader include, among others, Umberto Eco’s (206–207) \u003Cem>model reader\u003C/em>, Peter J. Rabinowitz’s (21) \u003Cem>authorial audience\u003C/em>, and Wolf Schmid’s (53–54) \u003Cem>abstract reader\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Digital media has brought new elements to the interaction between the reader and the text, and research on reading experiences of [ergodic literature] and the role of the player in the context of video games has broadened the concept of the implied reader.

Interactive Fiction uses text as the primary mode of reader engagement, and, while some now use multi-media effects, language is the primary vehicle for both narrative and ludic elements, such as puzzles. Works are often non-linear, and experiences of an interactive fiction vary from reader to reader. Authors, readers, and scholars mostly refer to Interactive Fiction by the initialism IF (pronounced /_aɪ - ef_/).\n\nThe first IF was _Adventure_ by Will Crowther, which was written in Fortran in 1975 and distributed on ARPANET (Montfort, _Twisty Little Passages_ 91). It was updated and expanded into _Colossal Cave Adventure_ by Don Woods the following year. Players explored magical caves by typing in two-word commands, such as ‘GO EAST’ or ‘TAKE LAMP’, and the system responded by describing the new or updated environment. _Adventure_ inspired a team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop _Zork_ (1977)_,_ which is considered the first commercially successful video game. Interactive Fiction companies, such as Infocom, sprang up to commercialize the form but eventually faded in popularity as improvements in graphics and memory enabled more multimedia games.\n\nHistorically, Interactive Fiction was synonymous with ‘text adventure games’, but now the form refers to a broader group of text-based narrative games. Earlier definitions of Interactive Fiction were rooted specifically in the mechanics of interaction; the use of a text parser and command-line interface were what made something IF (Douglass 129; Short). Nick Montfort distinguishes IF from other parser-based programs as one where player input is analyzed and to some extent understood; the work does not reproduce the same sequence of texts or a random sequence regardless of player input (Montfort, _Twisty Little Passages_ viii; Montfort, ‘Toward a Theory’ 34). Even as late as the early 2010s, graphical and choice-based games were broadly excluded from being understood as IF (Plotkin 66). However, current definitions include both parser-based and choice-based IFs like _Depression Quest_ (2013) (The Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation). Choice-based IF can either refer to hypertext narratives or multiple-choice narratives and may include fewer puzzles or map-based logics as parser-based IFs.\n\nCommunity is central to IF, and it has cohered around both parser and choice-based projects. \\[Authoring software\\] and development systems like _Inform_ by Graham Nelson and \\[Twine\\] by Chris Klimas are free to use and offer robust (Anglophone) documentation and community support for new writers. Historically, the community used the newsgroup _rec.arts.int-fiction_ to communicate, but now there is the _intfiction.org_ forum, which offers hints, tips, conversation, and advice for readers and writers alike in English, Spanish, Italian, and French (The Interactive Fiction Community Forum). New work is often shared via regular competitions or ‘Jams,’ which are predominantly run by popular vote. The biggest competition is the Interactive Fiction Competition, which has been running annually since 1995.\n\nMany popular IF tools and their documentation are developed in English, but non-Anglophone IF communities thrive as well. There are distinct community fora and annual competitions, such as _Rayuela de Arena_ (Spanish), _ЗОК_ (Russian), _Grand Prix_ (German), and _Concours Annuel de Fiction Interactive Francophone_ (French). Some Sinophone IF is shared on traditional databases like IFDB; however, Sinophone electronic literature tends to be more forum-based and is also underrepresented in these databases (Guo).\n\nIF is a relatively accessible form of electronic literature, since it is regularly accompanied by walkthroughs and can often be smoothly transferred to an audio experience via screen readers for the blind and partially sighted. While there is a burgeoning trend towards commercialization in IF for well-known writers, via funding platforms like Kickstarter or Patreon, or where completed projects are available for purchase on Steam, the majority of new works are available to play for free.\n\nIn terms of thematic focus, Interactive Fiction often explores questions of choice, freedom, and agency. According to Hartmut Koenitz, recent Twine projects in particular have focused very thoroughly on issues such as ‘cultural desolation, personal identity, alienation’, perhaps because the writing process is more accessible than parser-based systems (Koenitz xii). Some smaller competitions will suggest specific creative constraints, such as projects that are based on a song or games that take place at a zoo (Chen et al.; _The Ryan Veeder Exposition for Good Interactive Fiction_). However, there are no topic limitations or restrictions inherent to the form.","src/content/terms/interactive-fiction.md","4eb107acaee0a596",{"html":1457,"metadata":1458},"\u003Cp>Interactive Fiction has been intertwined with the history of early video games, and the form persists with a dedicated—and growing—community of readers and writers.

According to Hartmut Koenitz, recent Twine projects in particular have focused very thoroughly on issues such as ‘cultural desolation, personal identity, alienation’, perhaps because the writing process is more accessible than parser-based systems (Koenitz xii). Some smaller competitions will suggest specific creative constraints, such as projects that are based on a song or games that take place at a zoo (Chen et al.; \u003Cem>The Ryan Veeder Exposition for Good Interactive Fiction\u003C/em>).

Said another way, a literary game is a media artifact that contains elements of literature and gameplay. Ensslin’s definition builds on the work of Montfort and Moulthrop, who wrote that the power of literary games may derive from the play between their literary aspects and their nature as games. Think of Mad Libs or Exquisite Corpse, whose parameters are largely textual and whose end results are influenced by the decisions made by those playing. These are literary games at their most basic.\n\nLiterary games existed long before electronic literature, but e-lit’s propagation and facilitation of the ludic in text-based media expanded both the definition and the scope of literary games by introducing, including, and/or incubating hypertext, nonlinear narrative, interactive/generative texts, and the like. Because of each genre’s reliance on digital technologies, electronic literature and literary games blur the boundaries between \"reader\" and \"player\"—a situation that has become all but ubiquitous with the rise of video games, which are now studied as both media and literary objects. Indeed, the history of video games maps onto the history of e-lit in fascinating ways: \"like other genres—including, importantly, novels and films—they began more as curiosities than as artistic media\" (Coltrain and Ramsay, 43), though that does not necessarily mean all video games are literary games. Traditional video games often focus one gameplay and mechanics at the expense of narrative, while literary games are centered on verbal and textual components and interactivity.\n\nAs an example of how one might decide whether a media artifact falls within the definition of \"literary game,\" let us consider Shelley Jackson’s hypertext novel Patchwork Girl. The literary aspects of Patchwork Girl are easy to find: it has long been designated a novel, and its connections to Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein are multitudinous to say the least. Anyone familiar with Patchwork Girl knows Jackson’s work is well-situated as a ludic hypertext in addition to being a literary one. There is no one way to read/play Patchwork Girl, and any number of readings can be stitched together as the reader interacts with the writing. And Jackson performs a particularly adept suturing of \"reader\" and \"player\" early in the graveyard section found first on Patchwork Girl’s title page. Upon clicking out of the \\{headstone} lexia, the reader is transported to the \\{out} lexia, which immediately changes perspective and reads \"Burdened with body parts, your fingernails packed with mud and chips of bone, you slink out of the graveyard. A kind of resurrection has taken place.\" This is a fantastic (in both senses of the word) point of view in/from which to write—it could be anyone: the reader, Jackson, Shelley, Patchwork Girl, or multiple someones else. Regardless of who the author is at this point, the reader has been carried into the story in an almost movie-like (or cutscene-esque) way that includes an establishing shot (the graveyard), a closeup (the headstone), and finally a from-the-grave first-person point of view wherein the resurrected creature/reader becomes both Patchwork Girl and a reader-creature hybrid capable of writing its own story. By so doing, Jackson and Patchwork Girl offer us the reader/player enmeshment that can be triangulated with the literary and ludic elements of the text to classify Patchwork Girl as a literary game. It may not be a perfect fit in all places, but its reliance on interactive storytelling and the reader/player’s decision aligns well with Ensslin’s categorization.\n\nWhatever form it takes, a literary game does not exist in a vacuum. This is because, as Clara Fernández-Vara wrote, \"When we analyze games, we study meaning within the game (meaningful play) and around it (cultural significance). The text is not limited to the work itself, but also to where the text is interpreted and by whom\" (6). Labeling a media artifact a \"literary game\" is largely an exercise in symbolism, but the possibilities inherent in the coupling of the ludic and the literary fit well within the porous confines of electronic literature.\n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Referenced\n\nColtrain, James, and Stephen Ramsay. \"Can Video Games Be Humanities Scholarship?\" *Debates in the Digital Humanities 2019*, edited by Matthew K.

Rooted in the Greek terms _techno_ (denoting art or craftsmanship) and _eikon_ (meaning image or likeness), technoeikon names the dynamic convergence of technological forms and visual expression within the digital text. Far from functioning as peripheral decoration, technoeikons—comprising animated text, graphic movement, layered soundscapes, and audiovisual sequences—constitute the very fabric of the narrative experience.

It is not a supplementary embellishment but an indispensable component of the digital work, actively shaping its \"semiotic fabric\" (Shanmugapriya and Menon 647). Through the integration of kinetic visuals, sound, and interactivity, the technoeikon demands the reader’s active engagement, making participation a vital aspect of the meaning-making process. Thus, technoeikon offers a powerful framework for rethinking the ontology of the literary work in the digital age—one where language, image, sound, and code are no longer separate modes but interdependent forces in the production of narrative meaning.As demonstrated in Priti Pandurangan’s _Meghadutam_, the technoeikon manifests vividly through the dynamic interplay of visual, auditory, and performative elements. Text appears and dissolves fluidly across the screen, morphing into symbolic shapes such as flowers, nautilus shells, waves, and ultimately, tears—each transformation corresponding to shifts in the narrative’s emotional arc.

Oxford University Press, 2013.","Transmediality is a term used to refer to the condition of a narrative phenomenon manifesting through different media. The concept of transmediality is complex and pertains to the various possibilities for encoding the phenomenon itself, with definitions that emphasize, to a greater or lesser extent, the substantial adaptations and transformations that such a medial transition inherently implies. In this regard, an example could be the _Lord of the Rings_ saga, whose primary passage from the literary medium to the cinematic one represents an effective result, reached through specific differences and meaningful additions to the original narrative object.\n\nThe first definition of the concept is attributed to Henry Jenkins (2006), who discusses the term in relation to the reproduction of the same narrative phenomenon across different media. Specifically, the author frames the term as a peculiar consequence of _Convergence Culture_, understood as a “cultural shift, as consumers are encouraged to seek out new information and make connections among dispersed media content” (3). It is this cultural shift ‒ namely, the rise of Convergence Culture ‒ that gives rise to transmediality. This shift has particular characteristics, the most important being the high degree of participatory involvement from the audience. In fact, Convergence should not be understood as a passive and inevitable collapse of various media into a single device, but rather as the possibility for the user to search for a narratively significant phenomenon across different media (3). Transmediality, then, becomes the primary condition for the narrative phenomenon in the increasingly participatory era of Convergence.\n\nThis convergent turn and the resulting transmedial condition, as thus defined, prove to be fertile on a theoretical level. The first result is the definition of “transmedia storytelling” (21), understood as the creation of a narrative system extended across different media that encourages the user to move ‒ figuratively ‒ across the platforms and peculiar manifestations of the narrative object itself. Nevertheless, this definition remains highly debated, as some scholars emphasize the participatory dimension of the user in the very creation of the transmedial narrative universe and in the production of its meaning, with a pronounced semiotic approach (Scolari 2009). Alternatively, the referents of this category may change, encompassing very different narrative phenomena, ranging from literary antecedents to the ecosystem of TV series (Ryan 2013).\n\nFurthermore, the definition of transmediality in recent decades has required a concrete distinction from the neighbouring concept of _intermediality_ (Schröter 2012), which, by comparison, remains focused on the superficial dimension of _in-betweenness_ among different media, without addressing the specific and contrasting transformations that the narrative object undergoes in its transition between media (Rajewsky 2018).\n\nUltimately, transmediality is employed as a hermeneutic concept centered on two coordinates: the contact between different media ‒ more and more frequent in the hyper-contemporary age ‒ and the high degree of participation that the user maintains within this universe of hybridizations and _across-media_ contacts. Precisely for this reason, a concept so inclined toward hybridization and participation proves useful in addressing the concerns of fields of study that may differ widely: from media theory to aesthetics, including literary criticism and the social manifestations of literature (Murray 2018; Policastro 2021).","src/content/terms/transmediality.md","14a3693f1fb9d763",{"html":1552,"metadata":1553},"\u003Cp>Transmediality is a term used to refer to the condition of a narrative phenomenon manifesting through different media.
