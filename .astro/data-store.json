Moore",["Date","2025-03-14T00:00:00.000Z"],"## Explication \n\nCombinatory text generation pre-dates electronic literature. From the Latin poet Porphyrius Optatianus in the 4th century, to the medieval theologian Ramon Llull, to Oulipian experiments in constraint (such as Georges Perec’s 1969 lipogrammatic novel La Disparition, which does not use the letter \"e\"), literature has a long history of formalized procedures that blur the boundary between algorithm and author. Or indeed the boundary between machine and author; John Clark’s 19th century Latin Verse Machine, for example, generated lines of Latin hexameter via an ingenious mechanical system of pulleys, levers, and cogs. \n\nComputational combinatory text generation is broadly similar to its pre-digital predecessors, with the main difference being that it is a computer, as opposed to a person or a mechanism, that arranges or permutes the chosen constitutive elements. Although it is important not to conflate electronic literature with combinatorial procedures, pioneering literary experiments with computers, such as Christopher Strachey’s 1952 love letter generator, or Theo Lutz’s 1959 Stochastiche Texte, are explicitly combinatorial in their procedural transformations of source texts. The former, for example, generates love letters by inserting a randomly selected element from a list of romantic words into an empty slot within a syntactic template (such as \"You are my [adjective] [noun]\"). The latter enacts a similar alliance of semantic randomness and syntactic determinism, though the very different textual output (Lutz’s source text is Franz Kafka’s novel The Castle) demonstrates the major effect that a human programmer can have on computational combination simply by curating the elements to be combined. These early examples of literary computation set the tone for many subsequent works of electronic literature; as Philippe Bootz and Christopher Funkhouser write, \"until the 1980s most works of digital poetry were combinatorial generators\" (83). \n\nFollowing advances in personal computing and the sea change of the internet, electronic combinatorial literature receded into the background as poets explored the kinetic, multimedial, and networked possibilities afforded by new technologies. These same technologies, however, also significantly increase the number of combinations that an algorithm can instantiate, and some writers have continued to produce combinatorial work. For example, Nick Montfort and Stephanie Strickland’s 2010 electronic poem Sea and Spar Between algorithmically combines and recombines a small set of words drawn from works by Herman Melville and Emily Dickinson to produce an ocean of text populated by some 225 trillion stanzas. In doing so, they exemplify the potential of computation to radically accentuate and dramatize a set of questions that are naturally raised by combinatorial literature: can an algorithm be an author? What kind of affectual or aesthetic impact, if any, can a mere procedure have on a reader? How can we interpret a system of combinatorial production when the number of possible combinations exceeds the cognitive capacities of a human reader? Is language itself just a database? \n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Referenced\n\nBootz, Philip, and Christopher Funkhouser. \"Combinatory and Automatic Text Generation.\" In *The Johns Hopkins Guide to Digital Media*, edited by Marie Laure Ryan, Lori Emerson, and Benjamin J.

posted on the Instagram social media platform, which is characterized by brief, visually appealing texts that often incorporate themes of personal identity, traumatic experiences, and emotional catharsis","Shweta Khilnani",["Date","2025-03-14T00:00:00.000Z"],"## Explication\n\nInstapoetry is the name given to a form of poetry which is circulated and read on social media platforms, primarily Instagram but also others like Twitter and Tumblr. On such platforms, poetry is consciously designed for circulation, resulting in a distinct literary and visual aesthetic. Instapoems are usually short, comprising a single stanza of four to six sentences with frequent line breaks; they are written in free verse and they often contain a complementary visual component. \n\nA fairly contemporary literary sub-genre, Instapoetry emerged in the early 21st century when figures like Rupi Kaur and Lang Leave began sharing their poems on Instagram and acquired a massive fan-following. Their popularity led to a resurgence of interest in poetry as a genre: specifically, published poetry collections authored by Instapoets regularly occupied the top positions on bestseller lists. Thematically, Instapoetry often deals with issues of personal experience, pain, and trauma that are reminiscent of self-help narratives. They espouse an aesthetic of minimalism as they employ simple and sparse language and imagery. Rupi Kaur is one of the most famous Instapoets; she has close to 4.3 million followers on Instagram and her published collections of poetry including Milk and Honey and Sun and her Flowers reached the top of bestseller lists.  \n\nThe popularity of Instapoetry sparked a lot of debate about its perceived lack of merit. It was ill-received by literary critics who denounced it as a base and commercialized form of poetry which is turning a noble art form into a mechanized industry (Bucknell 2020, Watts 2018). In a deeply critical essay, Rebecca Watts, an acclaimed poet, declared that such \"artless poetry\" (13) is characterized by a \"denigration of intellectual engagement and rejection of craft\" (13) and depends instead on a \"cult of personality\" (14). Similarly, popular literary publications also attacked Instapoetry (Leszkiewicz) and called it \"cliched, banal, derivative, portentous, repetitive and manipulative\" (Hodgkinson, n.p.). Watts' essay triggered a series of responses which deemed her stance elitist. For instance, poet and researcher Katie Ailes argues that the qualities of honesty and authenticity which have become synonymous with Instapoetry deserve to be studied without condescension. Over the years, research around Instapoetry has diversified as scholars have debated its inclusion under the tag of e-literature (Berens) while others like JuEunhae Knox have studied it as the site of interactions between digital activism, algorithmic gatekeeping and commercialism.  \n\nWhile Instapoetry is a global phenomenon and a sizable part of it is written in English, there are more language and country specific variations of Instapoetry that have evolved over the years. Such poetry often incorporates local experiences and comments on contextualised political and socio-cultural issues.\n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Referenced\n\nAiles, Katie. \"'Instapoetry' in the LRB:

Game","Media artifact that contains both ludic and literary elements","Calvin Olsen",["Date","2025-03-14T00:00:00.000Z"],"## Explication\n\nAstrid Ensslin defines literary games as \"a hybrid subgroup of creative media that has both readerly and playerly characteristics\" (1). Said another way, a literary game is a media artifact that contains elements of literature and gameplay. Ensslin’s definition builds on the work of Montfort and Moulthrop, who wrote that the power of literary games may derive from the play between their literary aspects and their nature as games. Think of Mad Libs or Exquisite Corpse, whose parameters are largely textual and whose end results are influenced by the decisions made by those playing. These are literary games at their most basic.\n\nLiterary games existed long before electronic literature, but e-lit’s propagation and facilitation of the ludic in text-based media expanded both the definition and the scope of literary games by introducing, including, and/or incubating hypertext, nonlinear narrative, interactive/generative texts, and the like. Because of each genre’s reliance on digital technologies, electronic literature and literary games blur the boundaries between \"reader\" and \"player\"—a situation that has become all but ubiquitous with the rise of video games, which are now studied as both media and literary objects. Indeed, the history of video games maps onto the history of e-lit in fascinating ways: \"like other genres—including, importantly, novels and films—they began more as curiosities than as artistic media\" (Coltrain and Ramsay, 43), though that does not necessarily mean all video games are literary games. Traditional video games often focus one gameplay and mechanics at the expense of narrative, while literary games are centered on verbal and textual components and interactivity.\n\nAs an example of how one might decide whether a media artifact falls within the definition of \"literary game,\" let us consider Shelley Jackson’s hypertext novel Patchwork Girl. The literary aspects of Patchwork Girl are easy to find: it has long been designated a novel, and its connections to Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein are multitudinous to say the least. Anyone familiar with Patchwork Girl knows Jackson’s work is well-situated as a ludic hypertext in addition to being a literary one. There is no one way to read/play Patchwork Girl, and any number of readings can be stitched together as the reader interacts with the writing. And Jackson performs a particularly adept suturing of \"reader\" and \"player\" early in the graveyard section found first on Patchwork Girl’s title page. Upon clicking out of the \\{headstone} lexia, the reader is transported to the \\{out} lexia, which immediately changes perspective and reads \"Burdened with body parts, your fingernails packed with mud and chips of bone, you slink out of the graveyard. A kind of resurrection has taken place.\" This is a fantastic (in both senses of the word) point of view in/from which to write—it could be anyone: the reader, Jackson, Shelley, Patchwork Girl, or multiple someones else. Regardless of who the author is at this point, the reader has been carried into the story in an almost movie-like (or cutscene-esque) way that includes an establishing shot (the graveyard), a closeup (the headstone), and finally a from-the-grave first-person point of view wherein the resurrected creature/reader becomes both Patchwork Girl and a reader-creature hybrid capable of writing its own story. By so doing, Jackson and Patchwork Girl offer us the reader/player enmeshment that can be triangulated with the literary and ludic elements of the text to classify Patchwork Girl as a literary game. It may not be a perfect fit in all places, but its reliance on interactive storytelling and the reader/player’s decision aligns well with Ensslin’s categorization.\n\nWhatever form it takes, a literary game does not exist in a vacuum. This is because, as Clara Fernández-Vara wrote, \"When we analyze games, we study meaning within the game (meaningful play) and around it (cultural significance). The text is not limited to the work itself, but also to where the text is interpreted and by whom\" (6). Labeling a media artifact a \"literary game\" is largely an exercise in symbolism, but the possibilities inherent in the coupling of the ludic and the literary fit well within the porous confines of electronic literature.\n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Referenced\n\nColtrain, James, and Stephen Ramsay. \"Can Video Games Be Humanities Scholarship?\" *Debates in the Digital Humanities 2019*, edited by Matthew K.

Dawkins proposed the term meme as an example of how a replicator could function in the same way as DNA. He defined it as the name for a \"new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation\" (249). The term was intended to rhyme with the word ‘gene’ and conveys a similar ability to be replicated and imitated. For Dawkins, this was a part of a \"larger effort to apply evolutionary theory to cultural change\" (Shifman 9). \n\nThe term became popular within the framework of digital or electronic texts, where it refers to any item such as a video, image or written text which is shared repeatedly by people on the internet, making it go ‘viral’ in the process. At the same time, people often modify or remix the content of such items, resulting in the production of countless derivatives which are socially, culturally and politically contextual. Due to these features, memes have been identified as key examples of postmodern digital poetics and third generation electronic literature (Flores).  \n\nOwing to their replicability and rapid circulation, memes are often studied within the rubric of participatory cultures in the digital realm. They are also characterized by their intertextuality as they refer to other memes and are embedded within a complex mesh of information and ideas. In the recent past, memes have played an instrumental role in the articulation of several digital narratives. For instance, memes were employed extensively during the 2016 US Presidential Elections to share grassroot political ideas (Moody-Ramirez and Church). They were also used extensively to shape popular digital narratives during the coronavirus pandemic (Saint Laurent et al.).  \n\nMemes have been studied as a \"secondary layer of language\" in digital spaces, engendering new forms of memetic participation (Shifman). Critics have also studied the peculiar semiotic practices inherent in memes and how these express ideological practices (Wiggins).  \n\n::see-also\n\n## Works Referenced\n\nDe Saint Laurent, Constance, Vlad P.
